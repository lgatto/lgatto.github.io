On the 17 August 2017, I participated in a panel discussion about peer
review organised by Cambridge University Press (CUP). This post
summarises some of the questions and discussion that I wrote in
preparation for the discussion. The panel discussion was filmed and a
30 minutes video will be produced as part of the [Peer Review
Week](https://peerreviewweek.wordpress.com/).

The official CPU Peer Review Week page is [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/peer-review-week-2017).

Note that in the text below, I will systematically refer to the
*dissemination of research outputs* and explicitly avoid talking about
*publishing research papers*. This is for two reasons: (i) we mustn't
limit ourselves to papers (or books) but promote or more diverse set
of outputs that better represent the actual work more and (ii)
publishing is most often done by publishers that have conflicting
interest due to their commercial nature.

## About me

My name is [Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/about/)
(I'm [lgatt0](https://twitter.com/lgatt0) on twitter). I am a
principal investigator in the Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, where
I lead
the
[Computational Proteomics Unit](https://lgatto.github.io/cpu-lab/). I
am a computational biologist, and my research focuses on
high-throughput biological data and the development and application of
computational methods and software to shed new light on biological
data and biological processes.

I also consider myself an open and digital scholar. I value every
aspects of open science, from open
and [FAIR](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) (Findable and
Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable) data, open and
collaborative software development, open access, open peer review
(when appropriate), fast dissemination of research through pre-prints,
...

My views on peer review will reflect my interests and area of
research: open and collaborative research, and open dissemination of a
variety of research outputs, including papers (not as much books) as
well as data and software.

## What does good peer review look like to each panellist?

In my opinion, good peer review should

- Support the **dissemination of sound and valid research**
- Highlight **areas that need or could be improved**
- Provide **constructive comments**

The focus being on **validity** (as opposed to novelty, relevance,
...)  and I think that some emphasis should be put on the **data**,
**software** and **methods** underlying the claims to promote and
support better **reproducibility** of, and thus greater trust in the
research.


Good peer review should be also **multidisciplinary**. Given the
increasing multidisciplinary nature of a lot research, peer review has
to follow the trend. I don't think peer review can still claim it's
gold standard status if peer review relies on a limited number of
reviewer that often won't possess all necessary skills to cover the
multidisciplinary nature (and that includes technical expertise in
terms of data, data processing, software, ...) of the research.

**Transparency** would also be a feature of good peer review, as
transparency leads to greater trust. I don't necessarily think that
transparency implies open/public peer review.

**Timely** peer review is important, with the reservation however that
speed shouldn't reduce quality and depth of the review. That's where
pre-prints play an important role, so that one can disseminate
research independently of a possibly lengthy peer review process.


## What do publishers do to support good Peer Review and what could they do better?

I personally haven't seen many publishers do much for peer
review. Three spring to mind: 

- [PeerJ](https://peerj.com/) has a nice interface to enter your peer
  review and they explicitly offer the possibility to post reviews
  (speaker as a peer reviewer here);
- [F1000Research](https://f1000research.com/about) and they open
  review/commenting system (reviewer and author);
- the consultative peer review
  of [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/about/peer-review), although I
  haven't personally experienced it yet.

But I am not sure that publishers should be those to drive peer
review. I would very much prefer active researchers to play the key
role here. Read more about my views on publishers role in peer review
below.


## Are current practices of peer-review appropriate and sustainable in the future?

I think that serious improvements is needed. Research processes and
outputs (in terms of quantity and complexity) have increased, and
continue to do so, and pressure to publish is hitting researchers, in
particularly early career researchers (ECR) hard. Traditional peer
needs to adapt.

One aspect that I think is generally accepted is that peer review
doesn't scale. There are too many research papers and in some fields,
individual papers draw from many disciplines and skills that can't be
covered by 2 reviewers. We know peer review isn't perfect, and these
conditions will limit its scope. So I think that it is important to
accept that peer review, even if it has been considered the gold
standard for many years, doesn't deliver to the same extent anymore,
and that it is important to consider other models, such as
systematic submission of pre-prints and their acceptance as
first-class research outputs (many funding bodies do so) and
post-publication peer review.

I am of the opinion that there isn't necessarily a single model that
would fit all disciplines and types of publications (journals, books,
data, software, ...), that a combination of peer review models might
be necessary (for instance open, single and double blind), and that it
is important for us to experiment and gather data on how best
disseminate and review our work.

## Does peer-reviewing benefit the reviewers, or is it just for the benefit of the authors and end-readers?

Peer review should benefits the author in helping them producing
better research outputs, but that's certainly not universal. 

The benefits for the peer reviewer are that they learn about some
research before it's published (although that's not necessarily true
with pre-prints). Another important benefit is that by peer reviewing,
one becomes known by the more senior peers/editors; it's a way to
become part of an exclusive clubs.

There are also big benefits for the publishers - peer review is very
low cost for them but is used to promote the perceived quality of
their publications (irrespective of the actual average quality of the
review), which in turn is expected to sustain their business.

Readers will benefit from peer review as long as it improves the
quality of the output without delaying it too much.

## What are the roles of open vs blind review?

Open to debate. I prefer my reviews to be open, but there are also
situations where blind review has advantages (in particular for ECR
and under-represented minorities). 

I have never participated in a double blind peer review, but I am
pretty sure it wouldn't be too difficult to the reviewer to identify
the group the work originates from.

## Why hasn't post-publication peer-review taken off? With the pressure for rapid online publication, should post-publication peer-review be taken more seriously?

I think that the main reason it hasn't taken off is lack of
incentives. It is still seen as a free, altruistic service outside of
the traditional and rigid academic system.

## Could traditional pre-publication peer-review survive without publishers mediating it?

Why not? 

I don't see publishers as particularly important players in the
dissemination of research papers (things might be somehow different
for books, although the lack of open access policies for books is a
problem). The problems I see are that publishers deal only with a
limited number of research outputs (research manuscripts and books),
have failed to support and promote data sharing and reproducible
research for many years (there is a slow start among a few now), have
promoted ill-informed metrics to promote their business, and are
driven, at least partly, by market shares and profit. 

There's a spectrum of offenders, of course, and some publishers that
genuinely try to innovate in favour of the dissemination of
research. From my perspective, the commercial aspects of publishers
haven't had the best impact of dissemination of research outputs, and
there is an argument to be made
that
[scholarly communications shouldn’t just be open, but non-profit too](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2017/08/15/scholarly-communications-shouldnt-just-be-open-but-non-profit-too/).

One experiment I would like to see is for publishers to invite authors
to submit their pre-prints. I have heard of such cases but I don't
know if this is something that is done more systematically by some
journals or publishers. 

## Gender bias in Peer review

There is a bias, and I believe it doesn't only affect women, but more
generally any under-represented minorities. I am no expert on the
matter but feel it is important to acknowledge the issue and make all
possible efforts to reduce any biais, both as part of the peer review
process as well as part of our efforts to
promote [open science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/).

## Future of Peer Review

I hope the future of peer review will be linked to the future of
research dissemination: open and transparent, focused on faster and
broader dissemination of our work.

## Some additional post-panel notes

During the panel discussion, Monica Moniz from CUP mention an approach
that I find very interesting, which is journals scanning pre-print
servers and invite authors to submit their work. I have only heard
few such cases on twitter but I think this would be a very nice thing
that I would be happy to see. I publishers do that, it would be great
for them to publicise it.

Publishers get involved at the very end of the process, once the
advertisement for the research is ready. Often, when it comes to
dissemination of the outputs of that research (data, software), and
the review and improvement of the work, it is too late. More openness
and transparency are features that we should thrive to initiate as
early as possible. Monica mentioned that there were efforts for
publishers to get involved early on. While I am sure there is room for
collaboration on such initiatives, I think it is important for the
research community to remain independent from publishers. History has
demonstrated that commercially driven interests of most commercial
publishers have harmed the dissemination of research
outputs. Publishers shouldn't be given even more power and control by
getting pretending to support researchers throughout the whole research
process (see for
example
[here](https://epriego.wordpress.com/2017/08/02/scholarly-communications-on-fire/) and
[here](https://epriego.wordpress.com/2017/08/03/scholarly-communications-on-fire-what-can-we-do/)). Publishers
could however get involved in supporting (financially) and promoting
(using) community-led initiatives and platforms. 

When it comes to submission for peer review, there are also some very
simple things publishers could do right away: spare us that silly and
stupid formatting, and make sure that the manuscripts we review are in
a format that suites reading and reviewing by putting the figures in
the text - as far as I understand, submission of figures separately is
only for the benefit of the publishers way down the line, if the paper
gets accepted.
