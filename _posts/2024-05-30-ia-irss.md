I was invited to contribute to a
[seminar/discussion](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7201099969779351552/)
on AI, and using language models in research. These are the notes I
prepared my short presentation. I am not presenting anything new, or
original - I will merely be sharing what I consider being the main
take home messages from information I have been collecting since April 2023.
I also realised that these don't seem to be widely known among my
immediate peers.

# Who am I

I feel it is important to say a few words to put my talk into
perspective:

- I am a [Computational Biologist](https://lgatto.github.io/about/),
  heading the [CBIO lab](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/) at the
  [de Duve
  Institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/research-group/laurent-gatto),
  [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/). We occasionally use/develop of
  DL in the CBIO lab as part of our research. I am not an expert in
  AI.
- I have never used ChatGPT or any similar tools, and I'll tell you
  why! I however actively follow discussions on AI and its impact on
  society.
- I will focus on ChatGTP and similar LMs that are released by large
  and very powerful commercial entities for wide public consumption. I
  am not focusing on application of DL, LM, or AI in general in
  research.


# Reference

If there's one reference to remember, it is this seminal paper from
March 2021, published in the Proceedings 2021 ACM Conference on
Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (FAccT '21)

**[On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too
Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922)** by [Emily

  female scientists working in AI. She was a co-lead of Google's
  *ethical AI* research team. In December 2020, her employment with
  Google ended after Google management asked her to either withdraw
  the paper before publication, or remove the names of all the Google
  employees from the paper.
- Margaret Mitchell was later also fired from Google.

# When can I use ChatGPT?

Following Yves Deville and Christine Jacqmot's recommendations
([ChatGPT : Menace ou opportunité pour l’enseignement
supérieur](https://oer.uclouvain.be/jspui/bitstream/20.500.12279/885.2/14/ChatGPT_UCL_2023_03_28_CC.pdf),
March 2023):

## Given that

LLMs have absolutely no notion of "true" or "false", nor any
understanding of what it is asked.

## Use it if

1.  You don't can about the validity of the results.
2.  You are an expert in the field.

Note: lots has been said about ChatGPT's "occasional" hallucinations
(beware of the **anthropomorphising** word here). They always
hallucinate. It just happens so that sometimes, what is made up, is
not wrong. I will come back to some of these points in the later
**stochastic parrot** section.

# At what cost?

Many have tested ChatGPT. Some ([New AI tools much hyped but not much
used, study says)](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x4g7x7jo)
possibly make regular use of the free and/or the paid version. It
might be used for important or minor/mundane tasks. But at what costs?

## Human cost

Human cost is real and current. It is not a potential science-fiction
picture of AI vs humanity. Such a picture diminishes the current human
cost of AI, as is force-fed by big tech.

Here are some investigations about worker exploitation at OpenAI and
Google with respect to the curation of AI-generated content:

- [TIME](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/):
  OpenAI Used Kenyan Workers on Less Than $2 Per Hour.
- [The
  Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/aug/02/ai-chatbot-training-human-toll-content-moderator-meta-openai):
  ‘It’s destroyed me completely’: Kenyan moderators decry toll of
  training of AI models.
- [Business
  Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-kenyan-contract-workers-label-toxic-content-chatgpt-training-report-2023-1):
  Kenyan Workers Paid $2/hr Labeled Horrific Content for OpenAI.

and

- [Fortune](https://fortune.com/2024/05/03/google-search-raters-wages-benefits-contractors-tech-ai-employment/):
  I’m paid $14 an hour to rate AI-generated Google search
  results. Subcontractors like me do key work but don’t get fair wages
  or benefits.

Note that this isn't specific to ChatGPT. Similar workers exploitation
has been documented for Meta/Facebook reviewers from the Global South.

**Already marginalised communities suffer the highest human cost.**

## Environmental cost

Note that this is also relevant for other cloud services, such as
video on demande (detail for
[Netflix](https://theconversation.com/que-sait-on-des-impacts-environnementaux-de-la-video-en-ligne-lexemple-de-netflix-229955)
here).

**Already marginalised communities (will) suffer the highest
environmental cost.**

## Intellectual property

Where does all that training data come from?

- What about the credit and licensing of text, voice and images of
  those that produced that data used for training.

# Stochastic parrot

I'll borrow here directly from the paper, to highlight specific issues
with the vast amounts of data needed to train these large models, and
the (absence of) meaning output by the models.


## Unfathomable training data

- Size doesn't guarantee diversity: from initial participation, to
  data filtering, the data reflect the hegemonic viewpoint.
- Data is static data, but social views change.
- Biais is encoding and amplified in the training data, in particular
  stereotypical associations and negative sentiment towards specific
  groups.
- Large data and the lack of curation, documentation and
  accountability lead to a major documentation debt, that can't be
  addressed after the fact.

**Systematic biais against already marginalised communities.**

## Stochastic parrot

> Coherence is in the eye of the beholder

- There is no meaning, no model of the world, no intend to communicate
  in ChatGPT's output.
- Perceived "fluency" and "confidence" give the illusion of (implicit)
  meaning and expertise.
- We tend to mistake the coherence of LLM outputs for meaningful text
  or expertise.

> Contrary to how it may seem when we observe its output, an LM is a
> system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic
> forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to
> probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any
> reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot.

It is important to note that, in addition to highlight the risks, the
authors do propose paths forward for LM research and development.

# AI contamination

AI-generated text is already ubiquitous on-line, and it becomes more
and more difficult to identify AI-generated text. How long until
AI-generated (meaningless) text (including as answers in Q&A sites),
will be (or are) re-used for training.

Outlets are terminating journalist contract to replace them by AI, and
independent writers are 'competing' against AI.

We have all faced AI chat-bots in so-called help-desks. But [AI
chatbots are intruding into online communities where people are trying
to connect with other humans](https://theconversation.com/ai-chatbots-are-intruding-into-online-communities-where-people-are-trying-to-connect-with-other-humans-229473).

> Both of these responses were lies. That child does not exist and
> neither do the camera or air conditioner. The answers came from an
> artificial intelligence chatbot.

> According to a Meta help page, Meta AI will respond to a post in a
> group if someone explicitly tags it or if someone “asks a question
> in a post and no one responds within an hour.”

There are prime examples of **enshittification** (from
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification)):

> Enshittification is the pattern of decreasing quality observed in
> online services and products such as Amazon, Facebook, Google
> Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber, and Unity. The term was
> used by writer Cory Doctorow in November 2022, and the American
> Dialect Society selected it as its 2023 Word of the Year. Doctorow
> has also used the term platform decay to describe the same concept.

# ChatGPT in research

-   Reproducibility? [AlphaFold3 — why did Nature publish it without its
    code?](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-01463-0)

    > When AlphaFold2 was published, the full underlying code was made
    > accessible to all researchers. But AlphaFold3 comes with
    > ‘pseudocode’ — a detailed description of what the code can do and
    > how it works.

    > [...] for AlphaFold2, the DeepMind team worked with the European
    > Molecular Biology Laboratory’s European Bioinformatics Institute
    > [...] Now, DeepMind has partnered with Isomorphic Labs, a
    > London-based drug-development company owned by Google’s parent,
    > Alphabet. In addition to the non-availability of the full code,
    > there are other restrictions on the use of the tool — for example,
    > in drug development. There are also daily limits on the numbers of
    > predictions that individual researchers can perform.

    papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/jan/26/science-journals-ban-listing-of-chatgpt-as-co-author-on-papers)

    peer review).


# Who benefits from ChatGTP/AI?

AI, as a [hyped-up surveillance business
model](https://www.helmut-schmidt.de/aktuelles/detail/die-rede-der-zukunftspreistraegerin),
force-fed by big tech:

- In search engines (Google's ["AI
  Overviews"](https://www.platformer.news/google-ai-overviews-eat-rocks-glue-pizza/)).
  Not the users.
- Use your social media photos, posts, info, ... to train AI. Not the
  users.
- Facial recognition. Not the citizens.
- Microsoft Windows
  [Recall](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24159258/microsoft-recall-ai-explorer-windows-11-surface-event). Not
  the employees.

**Already marginalised communities likely to benefit the
least. Privileged communities to benefit the most.**

# What about regulations?

In the light of what has been said so far, I think it is reasonable to
wonder whether regulations shouldn't be put in place, to address
current and future impact and scope of the technologies put in place,
their concrete risks and harms, and their implications in terms of
systematic (private) data collection and use. Every major big tech
company is investing vast amounts of money in AI technologies, data
centres, and data collection. And they are demanding returns on these
investments.

These same companies are actively lobbying to assure support in their
vested interested. This becomes clear when reviewing their
implications in various working groups and how AI is framed and
communicated to the public and various stakeholders.

Here are two examples, one very recent from the Guardian, and one that
directly relates to the influence of Silicon Valley on academia:

- [OpenAI forms safety council as it trains latest artificial
  intelligence
  model](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/28/openai-safety-council-chatgpt):
  The safety committee is filled with company insiders, including Sam
  Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and its chairman, Bret Taylor, and four
  OpenAI technical and policy experts. It also includes the board
  members Adam D’Angelo, who is the CEO of Quora, and Nicole Seligman,
  a former Sony general counsel.

- [How Big Tech Manipulates Academia to Avoid
  Regulation](https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence/):
  The discourse of “ethical AI” was aligned strategically with a
  Silicon Valley effort seeking to avoid legally enforceable
  restrictions of controversial technologies.

# Conclusions

Despite some notable failures with 'AI for public consumption' , one
can't ignore that there there are also success stories, and possibly
still untapped opportunities. But ...

> AI can be kind of useful, but I'm not sure that a "kind of useful"
> tool justifies the harm.
