I stumbled across [this
message](https://tldr.nettime.org/@_elena@mastodon.social/114522680510446087)
on mastodon, that directed me to 6 questions what one should ask
before adopting a new technology. These questions where posed by [Neil
Postman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Postman), a writer and
academic quite some time ago. A reply in that same thread add a link
to a 1988 [talk](https://youtu.be/dBlfPhsrvtw?si=RcaLON8mKESvh_hI)
where he expands one them.

- What is the problem that this new technology addresses?
- Who's problem is it?
- What problems do we create by solving this problem?
- Which people and which institutions might be harmed by a
  technological solution?
- What changes in language occur as the result of technological
  change?
- Which people and which institutions will acquire economic and
  political power when this technology is adopted?

These questions and the whole talk are acutely relevant today, in the
light of generative artificial intelligence, and how it is imposed on
everyone.

Whenever I hear about about advantages or usages of generative AI, I
always think about the problem they supposedly address, and whether
they actually really solve itm rather than the symptoms, and what
would be needed to actually solve the problem. And unsurprisingly,
generative AI hardly ever solves any real problem when it comes to
research or education. The latter is also addressed in Neil Postman's
talk above.

Here are two books that are on my reading list, that are relevant to
the talk and topic:

- [The AI Con](https://thecon.ai/) - How to Fight Big Tech's Hype and
  Create the Future We Want, by Alex Hanna and Emily M. Bender

- [The Mechanic and the
  Luddite](https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-mechanic-and-the-luddite-a-ruthless-criticism-of-technology-and-capitalism-jathan-sadowski/21312179) -
  A Ruthless Criticism of Technology and Capitalism, by Jathan
  Sadowski.
