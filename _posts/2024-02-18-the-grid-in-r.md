The [MuseeL](https://museel.be/) is the
[UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/) University museum in
Louvain-la-Neuve. Highly recommended. It's located to the lively
*place des sciences*, in a nice brutalist style building, formerly the
science university library. If you ever spend some time in
Louvain-la-Neuve, do spare a couple of hours to visit it.


As an academic and an 'amis du mus√©e', I can get in for free, and
sometimes enjoy the quiet and rather unique atmosphere to get some
work. The previous exhibition, named [The
Grid](https://museel.be/fr/evenement/visite-guidee/decouvrir-lexposition-grid-0),
was dedicated to the use of a grid in science. The poster and book of
the exhibition, shown below, shows a grid, formed of smaller, slightly
irregular squares. I thought this was a funny example to reproduce in
R.

![The Grid poster](/images/grid-poster.jpg)

The first thing I need is the be able to draw squares. The
`plotSquare()` function below plots on of width `width` at positions
`x` and `y`.

```r
plotSquare <- function(x, y, width) {
    x1 <- x - (width / 2)
    y1 <- y - (width / 2)
    x2 <- x1 + width
    y2 <- y1 + width
    rect(x1, y1, x2, y2)
}
```

Assuming I want an `nsq` by `nsq` grid of squares, below, I define
that value to be 10, to draw a total of 100 squares.

```r
## Number of squares
nsq <- 10
```

I also want some jitter, i.e. some random displacements from a perfect
10 by 10 alignment, set by the `amount` variables.


```r
## amount of square jittering
amount <- 1.2
```

Finally, I need to define how much space is dedicated to the border
between the squares.

```r
## border ratio
ratio <- 0.2
```

Assuming that the grid will have a width and a height of 100
(arbitrary) unites, below I define the width `sq_w` of a square,
considering the number of squares and the space that is dedicated to
the border between squares. One I have the with of a square, I can
compute the width `border_w` of the border between two squares.

```r
sq_w <- (100 / nsq) * (1 - ratio)
border_w <- (100 - (nsq * sq_w)) / (nsq + 1)
```

I can now compute the x and y position of my squares. Given that my
final grid is a square itself, these x and y positions apply to rows
and columns of squares.

```r
pos <- seq(border_w, 100 - border_w,
           length.out = nsq)
```

We can now produce the figure. I first define the margins of my plot
with the `par` function: the margins have width 1 and outer
margins 0. The `plot()` function doesn't plot anything (`type = "n"),
no axes, no frame, no labels. It however sets a grid itself, ranging
from -2 to 100, to accommodate my squares and borders.

```r
par(mar = rep(1, 4), oma = rep(0, 4))
plot(-2:(100 - border_w + 2), -2:(100 - border_w + 2),
     type = "n", xaxt = "n", yaxt = "n",
     xlab = "", ylab = "",
     frame.plot = FALSE)
```

The last step is to place the squares. The x and y positions are
symmetrical, i.e defined by the `pos` variable above: the lines and
columns are `pos[1]`, `pos[2]`, ..., respectively, and the squares are
added line by line, starting at line at `pos[1]`. A little amount of
noise (defined by `amount` above) is added to the actual x and y
position by the `jitter()` function.

```r
for (y in pos) {
    pos_x <- jitter(rep(y, nsq), amount = amount)
    pos_y <- jitter(pos, amount = amount)
    plotSquare(pos_x, pos_y, sq_w)
}
```

The final output (with `set.seed(123)`), with the parameter above is
show here.

The full script is available
[here](https://gist.github.com/lgatto/4fa4b3a8a6668a6b755b47da40d8ca81). The
fun part is of course to play with the parameters, which is left as an
exercise for the reader :-).


**Update 2025-04-07:**

I can across this [mastodon
post](https://mastodon.social/@safest_integer/114296256313964335) with
this elegant code chunk to generate a similar figure:


```r
library(tidyverse)
crossing(x = 0:10, y = x) |>
    mutate(dx  =  rnorm(n(), 0, (y/20)^1.5),
           dy  =  rnorm(n(), 0, (y/20)^1.5)) |>
    ggplot() +
    geom_tile(aes(x = x+dx, y = y+dy, fill = y),
              colour = 'black', lwd = 2,
              width = 1, height = 1,
              alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE) +
    scale_fill_gradient(high = '#9f025e', low = '#f9c929') +
    scale_y_reverse() + theme_void()
```
