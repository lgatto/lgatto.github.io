This is an modified version of the [Becoming a better scientist with
open and reproducible research](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-publ/)
talk that I gave at TU Delft in May 2019. This version is modified and
was prepared for the [Virtual Bioinformatics Student
Symposium](http://www.rsg-belgium.iscbsc.org/event/student-symposium/student-symposium-04-12-2020/)
on the 4 December 2020. The slides are available
[here](https://lgatto.github.io/2020_12_04_RSG_online/#1).

## Introduction

I am always particularly keen to discuss open and reproducible
research, which is a topic that is very close to my heart. Interacting
with early career researchers makes it even more thrilling because
those are the ones that will (hopefully) make a bigger change for the
best. Believe it or not, ERCs are unlikely to be able to rely on their
senior peers to drive that change.

**Disclaimer:** I wanted to my personal experiences and opinions. I am
not speaking from authority here. Authority generally comes from
seniority, and in most cases senior academics aren't those that have
much experience in open and reproducible research.

Another thing I don't plan doing here is listing technical solutions
on how to implement open and reproducible research. I would be very
happy to answer your technical questions if you have any, or follow up
by email or twitter. You'll also have the oportunity to discuss with
your peers during the social gathering, many of which will be able to
help very efficiently. The main reason I won't focus on technical
aspects of open and reproducible research is that I very much doubt
that technical aspects are the real barrier. We have many solutions at
hand. The real challenges are the (academic) environment we are in,
the inertia of academia and the vested interests of many senior
actors.

For a start, here are three quick remarks about open and reproducible
research in relation with the title of the talk/post, and I will of
course define/discuss these terms in more details later - I will just
assume for now that you know, at least vaguely, what I am referring
to.

> Open != good (by default)

- A piece of open research doesn't automatically make it good, where
  good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of closed
  research doesn't make it bad, where bad here is defined of low
  academic quality. So openness doesn't equate to academic
  quality. But openness provides some desired quality (i.e. desirable
  property) independent from academic excellent. Openness leads to
  trust (more details later).


> Reproducible != good (by default)

- A piece of reproducible research doesn't automatically make it good,
  where good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of non
  reproducible research doesn't make it bad, where bad here is defined
  of low academic quality. So reproducible doesn't equate to academic
  quality. But reproducibility provides some desired quality
  (i.e. desirable property) independent from academic
  excellent. Reproducibility leads (among other things) to trust (see
  details below).

And

- Open research and reproducible research aren't the same thing, and
  one doesn't imply the other. Even though in our modern understanding
  of these terms and concepts, they are intimately linked,
  historically, they are very different.

While a lot of the things I will talk about are relatively recent (I
consider myself a *modern* open researcher), note that the principles,
implicit or explicity of open research/science aren't new. I was
pleasantly surprised when learning about the **[Mertonian
norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms)** from 1942.

- **Communism**: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific
  goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration;
  secrecy is the opposite of this norm.

- **Universalism**: scientific validity is independent of the
  socio-political status/personal attributes of its participants.

- **Disinterestedness**: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
  common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
  individuals within them

- **Organised scepticism**: scientific claims should be exposed to
  critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
  institutional codes of conduct.


## So what is open research?

Open science has seen a continuous evolution since the 17th century,
with the advent of dissemination of research in scientific journals
and the societal demand to access scientific knowledge at
large. Technology and communication has further accelerated this
evolution, and put it in the spot light among researchers and
academics (for examples funder mandates) and more widely in the press
with the cost of publications (see for example this Guardian *long
read* article [Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific
publishing bad for
science?](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science)
or the [Paywall](https://paywallthemovie.com/) movie).

So what is open research? What characterises a modern open researcher?

Let's start with a definition

> Open science/research is the process of transparent dissemination
> and access to knowledge, that can be applied to various scientific
> practices (image below from Wikipedia):

and a figure

![The six principles of open science](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Open_Science_-_Prinzipien.png)


What I dislike about the previous figure is that it can give the
misleading impression that open research is about collecting badges,
and that the more badges you possess, the better an open researcher
you are. And reciprocally, not having any badge to display
**excludes** one from being an open researcher. And as soon as people
start to believe this, we will stop practicing open research and will
start doing stamp collection.

Incidently, here's an ironic tweet that offers tips to do exactly that:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">21 Tips on
how to sound <a
href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#openscience</a>:

how to sound like an open scientist, without actually doing open
science. Enjoy! <a

3, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async
src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>

On a side note, I very much prefer the Mertonian norms shown above
that address more fundamental principles intimately related to the
principles of open research.

> Open science/research can mean different things to different people,
> in particular when declined along its many **technical**,
> **administrative**, **legal** and **philosophical** attributes.

An important word above is **excludes**: as thriving open researchers,
we need to understand that it isn't only the distance towards
better/open research that we have travelled that is relevant, but that
the starting point matters a lot. The way somebody practices open
research, whether that person has the possibility to implement this or
that open (and reproducible) research practice, or whether they can be
vocal about it mostly depends on their environment and the support or
push back they get.


Embrace open and reproducible research to the extend you want and you
can. Seek allies and support around you, but do not feel pressured. It
isn't open or close. It is certainly not the same open or close for
everybody.

So my very first take-home messages are:


> Open isn't binary, it's a gradient, it's multidisciplinary, it's
> multidimensional.

How to be an open scientist:

> Let's be open and understanding of different situations and
> constraints, including our own.

## Perverse side-effect: open research as a business

Everything that is labelled as open research isn't open of good. An
easy example is ~~Open Access~~ **Open Acce$$**, a very lucrative
business model set up by commerical publishers... and supported,
directly or indirectly by most researchers.

- **Green open access**: post your **pre-print** (on
  [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), [bioRXiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/),
  ...), get a DOI and credit. :-)

- **Gold open access**: pay a lot of moeny (APC article processing
  charge), typically 3000 -
  [9500](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y) Euros
  (which many will be [ready to
  pay!](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/natures-oa-fee-seems-outrageously-high-many-will-pay-it))
  to publish your article in a journal under an open access
  licence. **For-profit** publishing (typically **huge profits**). :-(

- **Platinum (diamond) open access**: 100% free to pubish and free to
  read, usually financed by university, funders, research
  organisations centrally. **Non-profit publishing**. :-)

- **Read and publish 'transformative' agreements**: combining
  subscriptions (to read) and APCs into big deals, this (1)
  obfuscating real costs, (2) lock-in into a contract with specific
  publishers, and (3) discriminate against institutions/countries that
  can't afford them (see this
  [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TUuoHV8yA0TSLUCo0PhrzfR5lwWruZQibKimOoVVJ6E/edit?usp=sharing)
  by Corina Logan and Dieter Lukas for more details). :-(

and

As far as I was concerned for a long time (until June 2017 to be
accurate - this section is based this [Open science and open
science](https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/) post), the former
more technical definition was always what I was focusing on, and the
second community-level aspect of openness was, somehow, implicit from
the former, but that's clearly not the case.

Even if there are efforts to promote diversity, under-represented
minorities (URM) don't necessarily feel
[included](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1101.full).
When it comes to open science/research URMs can be further
discriminated against by greater exposure or, can't always afford to
be vocal.

- Not everybody has the privilege to be open.
- There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one
  could afford to be.
- Every voice and support is welcome.

Given the very broad views and opinions about what open research is,
or is supposed to be, I think we can agree with [Cameron
Neylon](https://twitter.com/CameronNeylon/status/895546085468495873):

## Ethical publishing

[Corina Logan](http://corinalogan.com/)
([@LoganCorina](https://twitter.com/LoganCorina) on twitter) started
to talk already many years ago about ethical publishing (for research
dissemination at large). I wasn't immediately sold on the phrasing,
but I now came to the realisation that it's absolutely spot on.

> We should think about the ethical implications of how we perform and
> disseminate our research.

(Thank you Corina).

## Why becoming an open research practitioners

It's the right thing to do. See the **The Mertonian norms**... Or is it?

**Benefits for your academic career**: [How open science helps
researchers
succeed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4973366/) and
more examples from the [Open as a career
boost](https://lgatto.github.io/EPFL-open-science/) paragraph:

- Open access articles get more citations.
- Open publications get more media coverage.
- Data availability is associated with citation benefit.
- Openly available software more likely to be used. (I don't have any
  reference for this, and there are of course many couter examples).
- Benefit from institutional support of open research practices

**Networking opportunities** (I gave a [similar talk in May
2019](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-publ/) thanks to my open research
activities with my former colleague Marta Teperek at the University of
Cambridge, UK).

See also [**Why Open Research**](http://whyopenresearch.org/index)

- **Increase your visibility**: Build a name for yourself. Share your
  work and make it more visible.

- **Reduce publishing costs**: Open publishing can cost the same or
  less than traditional publishing.

- **Take back control**: Know your rights. Keep your rights. Decide
  how your work is used

- **Publish where you want**: Publish in the journal of your choice
  and archive an open copy. (See [The cost of
  knowledge](http://thecostofknowledge.com/) boycott of Elsevier).

- **Get more funding**: Meet funder requirements, and qualify for
  special funds such as the Wellcome Trust [Open Research
  Fund](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/open-research-fund).

- **Get that promotion**: Open research is increasingly recognised in
  promotion and tenure. See also [Reproducibility and open science are
  starting to matter in tenure and
  promotion](https://cos.io/blog/are-reproducibility-and-open-science-starting-matter-tenure-and-promotion-review/)
  July 14th, 2017, Brian Nosek) and the EU's [Evaluation of Research
  Careers fully acknowledging Open Science
  Practice](https://cdn1.euraxess.org/sites/default/files/policy_library/os-rewards-wgreport-final_integrated_0.pdf)
  defines an Open Science Career Assessment Matrix (OS-CAM):

But are there **any risks**?

> Does it take more time to work openly?

Isn't it worth investing time is managing data in a way that others
(including future self) can find and understand it? That's, IMHO,
particularly important from a group leader's perspective, where I
want to build a corpus of data/software/research that other lab
members can find, mine and re-use.

> Are senior academics always supportive?

No. (not necessarily)

> Is there a risk of being scooped?

There certainly is a benefit if releasing one's research early!

But, importantly, working with open and reproducible research in mind
**doesn't mean releasing everything prematurely**, it means

- managing research in a way one can find data and results at every
  stage

- one can **reproduce/repeat** results, re-run/compare them with new
  data or different methods/parameters, and

- one can **release** data (or parts thereof) when/if **appropriate**.

So, are there any risks?

## Why isn't it all open?

Or, as [Mick Watson (2015)](https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-015-0669-2) puts it:

![When will ‘open science’ become simply ‘science’?](/images/doi-13059-015-0669-2.png)

> **Abstract** Open science describes the practice of carrying out
> scientific research in a completely transparent manner, and making
> the results of that research available to everyone. Isn’t that just
> ‘science’?

There are **aggravating circumstances**:

[The natural selection of bad
science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsos.160384)
(Smaldino and McElreath, 2016)

![The natural selection of bad science](/images/doi-10.1098-rsos.160384.png)

> **Abstract** Poor research design and data analysis encourage
> false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial
> calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something
> more than just misunderstanding. **The persistence of poor methods

> discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but
> does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving
> the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.

Incentives for open career progression aren't there (yet?), or not
fully implemented. On the contrary...

> If *research is the by-product of researchers getting promoted* (a
> quote by
> [David Barron, Professor of Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Barron),
> Prof. Leslie Carr, personal communication), then shouldn't we, early

> disseminate our findings using modern channels?

But see the [**Declaration on Research Assessment
(DORA)**](https://sfdora.org/) to improve the ways in which the
outputs of scholarly research are evaluated.

Their objectives are (taken from their web page):

- **Raise awareness**: To call attention to new tools and processes in
  research assessment and the responsible use of metrics that align
  with core academic values and promote consistency and transparency
  in decision-making

- **Facilitate implementation**: To aid development of new policies
  and practices for hiring, promotion, and funding decisions

- **Catalyze change**: To spread research assessment reform broadly by
  working across scholarly disciplines and globally

- **Improve equity**: To call for broader representation of
  researchers in the design of research assessment practices that
  directly address the structural inequalities in academia


In my opinion, barriers are not technological, but rather
socio-cultural and political.

- Systemic control and inertia
- Vested interests by people in charge
- Abuse of power dynamics
- Fear of being scooped (an editorial in PLoS Biology on [*The
  importance of being
  second*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2005203)
  and, and how they prefer to focus on *complementary research*,
  recognising its important role in reproducibility of science.)
- Fear of not being credited
- Fear of errors and public humiliation, risk for reputation
- Fear of information overload
- ...
- Fear of becoming less competitive in a over-competitive market!

Many if not all of these fears are only *perceived* risks.



## Why reproducibility is important

- For **scientific reasons**: think reproducibility crisis.

- For **political reasons**: public trust in science, in data, in
  experts; without (public) trust in science and research, there won't
  be any funding anymore. Lack of (public) trust in science leads to
  poor public health decisions!

## But what do we mean by reproducibility?

From a [*But what to we mean by
reproducibility?*](https://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/)
blog post.

- **Repeat** my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results
  using the same setup (data, software, ...) in the same lab or on the
  same computer. That's basically re-running one of my analysis some
  time after I original developed it.

- **Reproduce** an experiment (not mine), i.e. obtain the same
  tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
  using the same setup (the data would be downloaded from a public
  repository and the same software, but possibly different version,
  different OS, is used). I suppose, we should differentiate
  replication using a fresh install and a virtual machine or docker
  image that replicates the original setup.

- **Replicate** an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
  tables/graphs/results in a different set up. The data could still be
  downloaded from the public repository, or possibly
  re-generate/re-simulate it, and the analysis would be re-implemented
  based on the original description. This requires openness, and one
  would clearly not be allowed the use a black box approach (VM,
  docker image) or just re-running a script.

- Finally, **re-use** the information/knowledge from one experiment to
  run a different experiment with the aim to confirm results from
  scratch.

Another view (from a talk by [Kirstie
Whitaker](https://figshare.com/articles/Publishing_a_reproducible_paper/4720996/1)):

|                    | Same Data | Different Data |
|--------------------|-----------|----------------|
| **Same Code**      | reproduce | replicate      |
| **Different Code** | robust    | generalisable  |

## More reasons to become a reproducible research practitioners

Florian Markowetz, [**Five selfish reasons to work
reproducibly**](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7), Genome
Biology 2015, 16:274.

[![Five selfish reasons to work reproducibly](/images/2017-09-22-selfish-rr.png)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0850-7)

> And so, my fellow scientists: ask not what you can do for
> reproducibility; ask what reproducibility can do for you! Here, I
> present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long
> run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented
> scientist.

1. **Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster**: a project is more than
   a beautiful result. You need to record in detail how you got
   there. Starting to work reproducibly early on will save you time
   later. I had cases where a collaborator told me they preferred the
   results on the very first plots they received, that I couldn't
   recover a couple of month later. But because my work was
   reproducible and I had tracked it over time (using git and GitHub),
   I was able, after a little bit of data analysis forensics, to
   identify why these first, preliminary plots weren't consistent with
   later results (and it as a simple, but very relevant bug in the
   code). Imagine if my collaborators had just used these first plots
   for publication, or to decide to perform further experiments.
2. **Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers**: Transparency
   in your analysis makes writing papers much easier. In dynamic
   documents (using
   [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/),
   [juypter notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and other similar tools),
   all results are automatically update when the data are changed. You
   can be confident your numbers, figures and tables are up-to-date.
3. **Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way**: a reproducible
   document will tick many of the boxes enumerated above. You will
   make me very happy reviewer if I can review a paper that is
   reproducible.
4. **Reproducibility enables continuity of your work:** quoting
   Florian, "In my own group, I don't even discuss results with
   students if they are not documented well. No proof of
   reproducibility, no result!".
5. **Reproducibility helps to build your reputation:** publishing
   reproducible research will build you the reputation of being an
   honest and careful researcher. In addition, should there ever be a
   problem with a paper, a reproducible analysis will allow to track
   the error and show that you reported everything in good faith.

<!-- - Reason number 1: **reproducibility helps to avoid disaster** -->
<!-- - Reason number 2: **reproducibility makes it easier to write papers** -->
<!-- - Reason number 3: **reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way** -->
<!-- - Reason number 4: **reproducibility enables continuity of your work** -->
<!-- - Reason number 5: **reproducibility helps to build your reputation** -->

## Does it take more time to work reproducibly?

**No**, it is a matter or relacating time!

## What can you do to improve trust in (your) research?

2. **Be an reproducible research practitioners**

Includes (but not limited to)

### Preprints are the best!

Read, post, review and cite **preprints** (see
[ASAPbio](https://asapbio.org/) for lots of resources about
preprints).

### Promoting open research through peer review

This section is based on my [The role of peer-reviewers in ~~checking
supporting information~~ promoting open
science](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html)
talk.

As an open researcher, I think it is important to apply and promote
the importance of data and good data management on a day-to-day basis
(see for example Marta Teperek's 2017 [Data Management: Why would I
bother?](http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.897785) slides), but also to
express this ethic in our academic capacity, such as peer review. My
responsibility as a reviewer is to

* Accept sound/valid research and provide constructive comments

and hence

* Focus on the validity of the research by inspecting the data,
  software and method. If the methods and/or data fail, the rest is
  meaningless.

I don't see novelty, relevance, news-worthiness as my business as a
reviewer. These factors are not the prime qualities of thorough
research, but rather characteristics of flashy news.

Here are some aspects that are easy enough to check, and go a long way
to verify the availability and validity and of the data

1. **Availability**: Are the data/software/methods accessible and
   understandable in a way that would allow an informed researcher in
   the same or close field to reproduce and/or verify the results
   underlying the claims? Note that this doesn't mean that as a
   reviewer, I will necessarily try to repeat the whole analysis (that
   would be too time consuming indeed). But, conversely, a submission
   without data/software will be reviewed (and rejected, or more
   appropriately send back for completion) in matters of minutes. Are
   the data available in a public repository that guarantees that it
   will remain accessible, such as a subject-specific or, if none is
   available, a generic repository (such as
   [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) or [figshare](https://figshare.com/),
   ...), an institutional repository, or, but less desirable,
   supplementary information or a personal webpage[^4].

2. **Meta-data**: It's of course not enough to provide a wild dump of
   the data/software/..., but these need to be appropriately
   documented. Personally, I recommend an `README` file in every top
   project directory to summarise the project, the data, ...

3. **Do numbers match?**: The first thing when reproducing someone's
   analysis is to match the data files to the experimental
   design. That is one of the first things I check when reviewing a
   paper. For example if the experimental design says there are 2
   groups, each with 3 replicates, I expect to find 6 (or a multiple
   thereof) data files or data columns in the data matrix. Along these
   lines, I also look at the file names (of column names in the data
   matrix) for a consistent naming convention, that allows to match
   the files (columns) to the experimental groups and replicates.

4. **What data, what format**: Is the data readable with standard and
   open/free software? Are the raw and processed available, and have
   the authors described how to get from one to the other?

5. **License**: Is the data shared in a way that allows users to
   re-use it. Under what conditions? Is the research output shared
   under a valid license?

[^4]: There is often no perfect solution, and a combination of the above might be desirable.

Make sure that the data adhere to the
**[FAIR](http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) principles**:

>  Findable and Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable

Note that SI are not FAIR, not discoverable, not structured,
voluntary, used to bury stuff. A personal web page is likely to
disappear in the near future.

As a quick note, my *ideal* review system would be one where

1. Submit your data to a repository, where it gets checked (by
   specialists, data scientists, data curators) for quality,
   annotation, meta-data.

2. Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data. First
   review the intro and methods, then only the results (to avoid
   positive results bias).

When talking about open research and peer review, one logical
extension is **open peer review**.

While I personally value open peer review and practice it when
possible, it can be a difficult issue for ECRs, exposing them
unnecessarily when reviewing work from prominent peers. It also can
reinforce an already unwelcoming environment for underrepresented
minorities. See more about this in the *Inclusivity: open science and
open science* section below.

### Publish, then review

eLife has very recently announced that they are implementing a
[**publish, then review**
model](https://elifesciences.org/articles/64910) of publishing:

> From July 2021 eLife will only review manuscripts already published
> as preprints, and will focus its editorial process on producing
> public reviews to be posted alongside the preprints.



### Registered reports

Define you data collection and analysis protocol in advance. Get it
reviewed and, if accepted, get right to publish once data have been
collected and analysed, irrespective of the (positive or negative)
result.

- **Three challenges**: Restrictions on flexibility (no p-hacking of
  HARKing), The time cost, Incentive structure isn’t in place yet.

- **Three benefits**: Greater faith in research (no p-hacking of
  HARKing), New helpful systems (see technical solutions below),
  Investment in your future.

See
[https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000246](Open
science challenges, benefits and tips in early career and beyond)
(2019).


### Make allies

> This is **very** important!

- Other ECR
- Librarians
- Data stewards/champions
- Research Software engineers
- On/off-line networking

Open research **can** lead to **collaborative research**. The
development of the [R for Mass
Spectrometry](https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/) initiative and
[`MSnbase`](https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase/) is [an
example](https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/) I am very proud
of.

Collaborative work and cooperation is certainly one important concept
that gravitates around open science/research (see the Mertonian norm
of *communism*), but that isn't necessary nor sufficient for open
science.

## Final food for thought

Science as [Amateur Software
Development](https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY), by Richard McElreath.

> Science is one of humanity's greatest inventions. Academia, on the
> other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has
> been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to
> other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science
> as a profession is largely *unprofessional*—apprentice scientists
> are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn
> promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software
> development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to
> playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring
> some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and
> back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed,
> open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be
> distributed, open-source knowledge development.

## Conclusions

Just do it! (if you are in a position to)

> Build openness and reproducibility at the core your research

(according to you possibilities)

Don't wait

> Open and reproducible research doesn't work if it's an afterthought.

> **Standing on the shoulders of giants** only really makes sense in
> the context of open and reproducible research.

- If you are here (or have read this), chances are you are on the path
  towards open and reproducible research.

- You are the architect of the kind of research and researcher you
  want to become. I hope these include openness and reproducibility.

- It's a long path, that constantly evolves, depending on constraints,
  aspirations, environment, ...

- The sky is the limit, be creative: work out the (open and
  reproducible) research that works for you now ...

- ... and that you want to work (for you and others) in the future.
