I have been wanting to reduce my usage and dependency on Github for
quite some time now.

My first initiative was to join
[codeberg.org]](https://codeberg.org/lgatto) (I did so on 9 June
2024). I am happy I did so, but Codeberg is a non-profit association
and has [storage
limits](https://blog.codeberg.org/new-storage-limits-on-codeberg-what-you-need-to-know.html),
and rightly so. But my usage of Github exceeded what they offer, so I
had to (1) carefully choose what to migrate and (2) adapt what/how I
store in repos (by switching some parts to
[git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/)).

My university has a [Gitlab](https://forge.uclouvain.be/) server but
with a limited number of private projects. Ignoring this limitation,
it is the right place for projects related to some of my teaching
activities, for example.



Github is still inevitable
- I have many projects/package that have been there for a long time,
  and that are expected to remain there;
- It is still the de facto infrastructure for many collaborative
  projects, and that is unlikely to change.
