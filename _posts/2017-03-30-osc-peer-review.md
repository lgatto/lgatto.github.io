Today, I participated in the
[How to get the most out of modern peer-review](https://www.training.cam.ac.uk/osc/event/2080517)
event organised by the
[Office of Scholarly Communication](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/). Here's a
short summary and some thoughts.

## From Journals

There were presentations from eLife (Dr Wei Mun Chan) and
F1000Research (Dr Sabina Alam, [@Sab_Ra](https://twitter.com/Sab_Ra))
in the *Innovations in peer-review* session. PeerJ was mentioned
several times, for publishing their peer reviews, for example.

I general, I think the presenters did a good job in demonstrating
modern peer review on how it can benefit authors and research in
general: eLife with its consultative peer review, where editors and
reviewers discuss their views and opinions before a decision is made,
and F1000Research with their open post-publication peer review
system. My personal experience with PeerJ (as a reviewer) and
F1000Research (as a reviewer and author) have been excellent. All
these journals are great venues for a modern open scholar.

Dr Jen Wright ([@JennWrights](https://twitter.com/jennwrights)) from
Cambridge University Press presented a nice and detailed overview of
how peer review works. I was well structured, following a FAQ
model. She also very entertainingly illustrated her talk with
references to [PHDcomis](https://twitter.com/PHDcomics),
[Lego Grad Student](https://twitter.com/legogradstudent) and
[Shit Academics Say](https://twitter.com/AcademicsSay).

## Open peer review

The highlight of the day was [Corina](http://corinalogan.com/)'s
([@LoganCorina](https://twitter.com/LoganCorina)) brilliant *Open peer
review - what is it and what does it achieve?* talk. She made a strong
point in favour of open peer review and reviewing ethics. Read her
[lab code of conduct](http://www.corinalogan.com/ethics.html) about
reviewing ethics, as well as publishing ethics, her commitment to
conducting rigorous science, lab interpersonal interactions. 

I was nice to hear how her efforts in ethical publishing and reviewing
proved to have been very positive for her academic career, which
contrasts to the fear that some early career researcher sometimes
express that practising open science and ethical publishing could
hinder their careers.

## The role of peer-reviewers in promoting open science

I was also very happy to have the opportunity to give a talk about the
role of peer review in promoting open science. My slides are available
[here](https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html). I
plan to write it up and expand on it in a blog post.

In brief, my main message was that, it we want to promote rigorous
science, we have an obligation to make sure that the data, software
and methods are adequately shared and described, and that it was not
too difficult or time consuming to check this as a peer reviewer.

Currently, as far as data is concerned, my ideal review system would
be a 2-stage process, where

1. Submit your data and meta-data to a repository, where it get's
   checked (by specialists, data scientists, data curators) for
   quality, annotation, meta-data. 
2. Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data.

My talk earned me a lot of feed back and encouragements, both off and
online.

## Publons

I had heard about [Publons](https://publons.com/home/) before, but
never took the time to learn more about it. Tom Culley made a great
job at presenting it as a means to *Getting formal recognition for
your peer review work*. I will definitely give it a go in the near
future.

## Show me the data

I went to Dr Varsha Khodiyar's
([@varsha_khodiyar](https://twitter.com/varsha_khodiyar)) workshop
*Show me the data : tips and tricks with peer-reviewing research
data*. Varsha is the data curation editor at Scientific Data. I am not
necessarily a big fan of data journals (see
[here](https://lgatto.github.io/software-data-papers/) for some
background), but it is clear that she is doing great work making sure
that the data that she checks and curated (in addition to the peer
review) is available under an open license and of good quality.

When it comes to data/software submissions, I believe that often, many
shortcomings are more a result of lack of adequate skills or
experience in the process of good practice in sharing and documenting,
rather that poor quality of the output. The review process should
ideally serve as a way to support and education researchers, and the
[Bioconductor](https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions) and
[rOpenSci](https://github.com/ropensci/onboarding/blob/master/README.md)
projects are great examples of how the package review process is a way
to genuinely help the authors to improve on their output, rather than
a binary accept/reject outcome.

A closed 2-stage peer review, like is typically in place in journals
is a horrible system for than. An open review, with more interactions
between reviewers and authors would be a more efficient approach.

## More about the event

To hear more about the event, have a look at the
[#oscpeereview](https://twitter.com/hashtag/oscpeerreview) hashtag on
twitter. The event was live streamed and will be made available on
YouTube in the coming day - I will add a link later.

All in all, I think it was a great event. Kudos to the Office of
Scholarly Communication for their efforts and continuous
dedication. As emphasised by many participants, events like this
constitute a unique and important channel highlighting important
innovations in digital and open science that are redesigning
scholarship. They are also a unique venue where open researcher can
express and discuss challenges and opportunities with the wider
academic community.
