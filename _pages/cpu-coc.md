# Code of Conduct

All members of the lab, along with visitors, are expected to agree
with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as
needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe
environment for everybody.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age,
sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of lab
members in any form. Sexual language and imagery is generally not
appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations,
or discussions. 

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in
public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing
photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other
events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual
attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
or have any other concerns, please contact Laurent Gatto
immediately. If Laurent is the cause of your concern, Kirstie Whitaker
(kw401 AT cam.ac.uk) is a good informal point of contact; and has
agreed to mediate.

For official concerns, please see the Universities
[Public Equality Duties](http://www.equality.admin.cam.ac.uk/training/equalities-law/public-equality-duties)
page.

(This code of conduct is inspired from Titus Brown's
[Data Intensive Biology at UC Davis Code of Conduct](http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/coc.html).)
