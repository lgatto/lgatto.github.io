The CBIO group performs research and development in computational
biology at the faculty of pharmacy and biomedical sciences (FASB) at
the [UCLouvain](https://uclouvain.be/), in Brussels (Belgium). We are
located at the [de Duve Institute](https://www.deduveinstitute.be/)
and collaborate with groups of the various [research institutes on the
campus](https://uclouvain.be/fr/chercher/instituts-de-recherche.html%20#sss)
to tackle biomedically challenging questions using statistics and
machine learning. The development and publication of scientific
software ([1](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit),
[2](https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO),
[3](https://github.com/lgatto)) is an integral part of our work and is
reflected by our contributions to the
[Bioconductor](http://www.bioconductor.org/) project.

**Keywords**: data analysis, experimental design, statistics,
programming, R, scientific software, machine learning, reproducible
research, proteomics.

# Open Science and Reproducible Research

We are committed to the open, transparent and rigorous practice of
scientific enquiry. In particular, we make every possible effort to
make our [research repeatable, reproducible and
replicable](http://lgatto.github.io/rr-what-should-be-our-goals/), in
the hope that it can be re-used and improved upon by as many as
possible. Concomitantly, we release all our software and data
under open permissible licences. Finally, we will also ensure that our
research (such as, but not limited to journals articles,
presentations, and book chapters) is published under open access
licences to allow everybody to freely read, re-use and mine it.

# Good practice

Software engineering and programming are an important aspects of our
work. We hence try to adopt common good practice and coding style.

See the
[wiki](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit/cputools/wiki)
for some useful links.

# Code of Conduct

The lab is dedicated to providing a welcoming and harassment-free
experience for everyone, and we expect cooperation from all members
and collaborators to help ensuring a safe environment for
everybody. See the [Code of
conduct](https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-coc/) page for a longer
version.

# Funding

<!-- Since 2010, we have benefited from the financial support from the -->
<!-- **BBSRC**, the **7th Framework Programme of the European Union** -->
<!-- (Contract no. 262067 [PRIME-XS](http://www.primexs.eu/)) and the -->
<!-- **Wellcome Trust**. -->

The CBIO lab benefits from funding from
