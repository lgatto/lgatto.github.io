<p>This initial assessment is split into several parts, describing
different sources of data used for the assessment. The different parts
have been added over different times. Part 1 was originally added on
15 December 2022 and is based on direct, free-form informal and
semi-formal feedback. Part 2 is based on on-line evaluation forms that
students were invited to fill out and was published on 27 December
2022.</p>

<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>

<h3 id="third-bachelor-course">Third bachelor course</h3>

<p>Let’s start with the third bachelor student’s feedback, collected as
part of the ‘Year committee’, where student representatives meet with
the professors and share the feedback they collected among all
students. This is a cohort that experienced the previous approach,
where each weekly test was graded and students that earned a decent
weighted average would get a dispense for the final exam<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>While some students did prefer being kept on their toes with
marking, the majority appreciate dropping marking to reduce
stress/pressure during weekly tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The general pedagogy and the feedback are well received. In
particular, students like the post-it notes for in-class
interactions and feedback, and the possibility to book one-to-one
sessions to get individual feedback.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This year, we also have the support of a third TA, which helps a lot
to provide prompt technical help and answer questions without delay
during class.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The feedback we gathered on the post-it notes after the last lecture
and our subjective appreciation (based on the perceived motivation of
students, and the quantity and quality of their questions) is along
the same lines. Some students already mentioned on the post-it notes
that they were looking forward to next year’s (optional) Master’s
course, which is a strong argument in favour of our strategy.</p>

<h3 id="first-masters-course">First masters course</h3>

<p>This year, for the first time, students were asked to self-mark during
the final oral exam. They all provided a fair assessment of their
work, at times even slightly lower that what they really deserved (in
which case we obviously bumped the mark accordingly). I also
systematically asked what they thought they could have improved and if
more time would have helped. Interestingly, the topic of the last
project/presentations, which was a more open-ended and creative task,
was one point that came up repeatedly, with analysis approaches that
they didn’t think of but thought they should have.</p>

<p>We also considered some further updates for next year, to promote
feedback and allow students to act specifically on that feedback. For
the first report, that focuses on a <a href="https://uclouvain-cbio.github.io/WSBIM2122/sec-rnaseq.html">hands-on analysis of RNA-Seq
data</a>,
here are the steps that we plan to implement:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After receiving their data, students will give a first short
presentation focusing on introducing their dataset, the
experimental design, the biological question(s) they want to focus
on, and the associated statistical model(s). This is a first
opportunity for feedback and to make sure we catch any
misdirections early on.</li>
  <li>A full 4-hour session dedicated to questions and answers on their
data, the corresponding chapters, and how to prepare the report.</li>
  <li>A report, written in R markdown and compiled in pdf, detailing the
analyses introduced in the presentation above (point 1).</li>
  <li>We will read and annotate the reports, and provide an individual
feedback sheet including a short section with positive points, a
short section with possible improvements and a list of
questions. The questions we will ask during the end-of-term oral
exam (point 6 below) will be among those in this list, so that
students can prepare beforehand and thus address any short-comings
in their respective reports.</li>
  <li>Each students will receive another report to read and provide
constructive comments. This will allow them to explore how others
have addressed their project and experience how to critically read
and assess another person’s work (and thus reflect on their own
contribution).</li>
  <li>An oral exam to offer the students an opportunity to answer (some
of) the questions we handed them (point 4).</li>
</ol>

<p>As every year so far, I have also asked for students to comment on one
aspect of the course they particularly appreciated and one that they
did less, as well as an assessment of the amount of work they had to
invest. This is interesting as it provides them with an opportunity to
reflect on the whole course and discuss their impressions with us,
which we use to update and improve the course.</p>

<h3 id="next-assessments">Next assessments</h3>

<p>We need to consider whether the positive impact that we seem to
observe in the third bachelor’s course also translates into a better
success rate in the exam. I do have to admit that this makes me
slightly uncomfortable. What if we were to see a negative impact
(which, honestly, I doubt)? It wouldn’t necessarily mean that we did
worse, given that we have applied our new strategy on a single
cohort. This obviously also applied if we get better results - a
better or worse success rate might be the result other confounding
factors. However, this cohort will be the only that has experienced
the change in teaching strategy, and hence probably an ideal situation
for a direct assessment. If I’m being honest, I wouldn’t want to teach
to the test even if exam results were provable worse, for the many
reasons underlying the new <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/">ungrading and
feedback</a> strategy.</p>

<p>Next term, we start with a brand new second bachelor cohort. This will
also be an interesting experience, as they will be immediately exposed
to this <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/ungrading/">ungrading and feedback</a>
strategy (with us having a term’s worth experience), and will
experience and adapt<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to it over two years.</p>

<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>

<h3 id="on-line-questionnaire">On-line questionnaire</h3>

<p>This second part of the assessment looks at on-line evaluation forms
that 3rd bachelor students are asked to fill out. There are two types
of forms: one for the teaching unit (i.e the theoretical part of the
course) and a second one for the practical sessions. These evaluation
forms can be requested by the instructor or the faculty (and are
indeed asked for every three years by the latter, if I remember
well). I have three forms available, for two different cohorts.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluations for the teaching unit from 2021. That’s one that I
requested myself. Given that my courses blend theory and practice,
I only requested the teaching unit questions, asking students to
fill out the form considering both aspects. This form was completed
by 27 students (individual questions were answered by 25 to 27
students), corresponding to half of the class.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evaluations for the teaching unit and practicals from 2022. These
were requested by the faculty, hence for both parts. The requests
and links to the forms where received after completion of the
course, and I was only able to inform and remind students through
forum announcements, hence a low participation rate: only 7
students (with one question getting 6 answers), corresponding to
just under 12% of the full cohort. This probably induces some bias,
where only the most committed students, and hence those more likely
to provide positive feedback, participated.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Here are the score for the 2022 teaching unit and practical
sessions. The student answer each question<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> by providing a score
from 1 (<em>Don’t agree at all</em>) to 4 (<em>Totally agree</em>).</p>

<p><img src="/images/eval_scores_ue_22.png" alt="2022 evaluations for the teaching unit" />
<img src="/images/eval_scores_tp_22.png" alt="2022 evaluations for the practical sessions" /></p>

<p>These evaluation are quite good, especially when compared
to 2021. Below are the questions for the teaching unit of that year.</p>

<p><img src="/images/eval_scores_ue_21.png" alt="2021 evaluations for the teaching unit" /></p>

<p>I also computed the mean scores and standard deviations per question
to directly compare the 2021 and 2022 results. The figure below show
the 2021 results in the top left panel and the 2022 results in the top
right and bottom left panels. The top right panel is helpful to
compare individual questions and the bottom panel to get a more
general assessment of the 2021 vs 2022 scores. The dotted red line
represents the yearly mean score.</p>

<p><img src="/images/eval_mean_ue_21_22.png" alt="Comparison of mean 2021 and 2022 scores for the teaching unit evaluations" /></p>

<p>The improvement is striking, to say the least. There are however two
points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2022, given that the evaluation request came in late, it is
possible that only the most committed students participated, hence
boosting these scores up.</li>
  <li>The 2021 cohort had a hard time during the COVID lock-down. They had
to follow the second bachelor course (a prerequisite to the one
evaluated above) remotely, which was hard on them and is likely to
reduce the overall score.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even considering the above possible confounding factors, I am tempted
to take the figures from the student on-line evaluations as a strong
endorsement for the new teaching strategy. Hopefully, this will also
materialise in a likely part 3 to this post, describing the final exam
results.</p>
