I also realised that these don’t seem to be widely known among my

<h1 id="who-am-i">Who am I</h1>

<p>I feel it is important to say a few words to put my talk into
perspective:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am a <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/about/">Computational Biologist</a>,
heading the <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/">CBIO lab</a> at the
<a href="https://www.deduveinstitute.be/research-group/laurent-gatto">de Duve
Institute</a>,
<a href="https://uclouvain.be/">UCLouvain</a>. We occasionally use/develop of
DL in the CBIO lab as part of our research. I am not an expert in
AI.</li>
  <li>I have never used ChatGPT or any similar tools, and I’ll tell you
why! I however actively follow discussions on AI and its impact on
society.</li>
  <li>I will focus on ChatGTP and similar LMs that are released by large
and very powerful commercial entities for wide public consumption. I
am not focusing on application of DL, LM, or AI in general in
research.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="reference">Reference</h1>

<p>If there’s one reference to remember, it is this seminal paper from
March 2021, published in the Proceedings 2021 ACM Conference on

<ol>
  <li>You don’t can about the validity of the results.</li>
  <li>You are an expert in the field.</li>

<p>Note: lots has been said about ChatGPT’s “occasional” hallucinations
(beware of the <strong>anthropomorphising</strong> word here). They always
hallucinate. It just happens so that sometimes, what is made up, is
not wrong. I will come back to some of these points in the later
<strong>stochastic parrot</strong> section.</p>

<h1 id="at-what-cost">At what cost?</h1>

<p>Many have tested ChatGPT. Some (<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c511x4g7x7jo">New AI tools much hyped but not much
used, study says)</a>
possibly make regular use of the free and/or the paid version. It
might be used for important or minor/mundane tasks. But at what costs?</p>

<h2 id="human-cost">Human cost</h2>

<p>Human cost is real and current. It is not a potential science-fiction
picture of AI vs humanity. Such a picture diminishes the current human
cost of AI, as is force-fed by big tech.</p>

<p>Here are some investigations about worker exploitation at OpenAI and
Google with respect to the curation of AI-generated content:</p>

<p>Note that this isn’t specific to ChatGPT. Similar workers exploitation
has been documented for Meta/Facebook reviewers from the Global South.</p>

ugly truth behind ChatGPT: AI is guzzling resources at planet-eating
rates.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Despite its name, the infrastructure used by the “cloud” accounts
for more global greenhouse emissions than commercial flights. In
2018, for instance, the 5bn YouTube hits for the viral song
Despacito used the same amount of energy it would take to heat
40,000 US homes annually.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Furthermore, while minerals such as lithium and cobalt are most
commonly associated with batteries in the motor sector, they are
also crucial for the batteries used in datacentres. The extraction
process often involves significant water usage and can lead to
pollution, undermining water security. The extraction of these
minerals are also often linked to human rights violations and poor
labour standards. Trying to achieve one climate goal of limiting
our dependence on fossil fuels can compromise another goal, of
ensuring everyone has a safe and accessible water supply.</p>

(citing - <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02001">Estimating the Carbon Footprint of BLOOM, a 176B
Parameter Language Model</a>)</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>[Luccioni et al.] tallied the amount of energy used to train […]
Bloom, on a supercomputer; the energy used to manufacture the
supercomputer’s hardware and maintain its infrastructure; and the
electricity used to run the program once it launched. They found
that it generated about 50 metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions,
the equivalent of an individual taking about 60 flights between
London and New York.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>By contrast, limited publicly available data suggests about 500
metric tonnes of CO2 were produced just in the training of ChatGPT’s
GPT3 model 3 – the equivalent of over a million miles driven by
average gasoline-powered cars, the researchers noted.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Even more unclear is the amount of water consumed in the creation
and use of various AI models. Data centers use water in evaporative
cooling systems to keep equipment from overheating. One
non-peer-reviewed study, led by researchers at UC Riverside,
estimates that training GPT3 in Microsoft’s state-of-the-art US data
centers could potentially have consumed 700,000 liters of
freshwater.</p>

AI has a large and growing carbon footprint, but there are potential
solution on the horizon.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Since the AI boom started in the early 2010s, the energy
requirements of AI systems known as large language models (LLMs) –
the type of technology that’s behind ChatGPT – have gone up by a
factor of 300,000. With the increasing ubiquity and complexity of
AI models, this trend is going to continue, potentially making AI
a significant contributor of CO₂ emissions. In fact, our current
estimates could be lower than AI’s actual carbon footprint due to
a lack of standard and accurate techniques for measuring
AI-related emissions.</p>

<p>Note that this is also relevant for other cloud services, such as
video on demande (detail for
<a href="https://theconversation.com/que-sait-on-des-impacts-environnementaux-de-la-video-en-ligne-lexemple-de-netflix-229955">Netflix</a>
here).</p>

<p><strong>Already marginalised communities (will) suffer the highest
environmental cost.</strong></p>

<h2 id="intellectual-property">Intellectual property</h2>

<p>Where does all that training data come from?</p>

<ul>
  <li>What about the credit and licensing of text, voice and images of
those that produced that data used for training.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="stochastic-parrot">Stochastic parrot</h1>

<p>I’ll borrow here directly from the paper, to highlight specific issues
with the vast amounts of data needed to train these large models, and
the (absence of) meaning output by the models.</p>

<h2 id="unfathomable-training-data">Unfathomable training data</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Size doesn’t guarantee diversity: from initial participation, to
data filtering, the data reflect the hegemonic viewpoint.</li>
  <li>Data is static data, but social views change.</li>
  <li>Biais is encoding and amplified in the training data, in particular
stereotypical associations and negative sentiment towards specific
groups.</li>
  <li>Large data and the lack of curation, documentation and
accountability lead to a major documentation debt, that can’t be
addressed after the fact.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Systematic biais against already marginalised communities.</strong></p>

<h2 id="stochastic-parrot-1">Stochastic parrot</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Coherence is in the eye of the beholder</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>There is no meaning, no model of the world, no intend to communicate
in ChatGPT’s output.</li>
  <li>Perceived “fluency” and “confidence” give the illusion of (implicit)
meaning and expertise.</li>
  <li>We tend to mistake the coherence of LLM outputs for meaningful text
or expertise.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Contrary to how it may seem when we observe its output, an LM is a
system for haphazardly stitching together sequences of linguistic
forms it has observed in its vast training data, according to
probabilistic information about how they combine, but without any
reference to meaning: a stochastic parrot.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is important to note that, in addition to highlight the risks, the
authors do propose paths forward for LM research and development.</p>

<h1 id="ai-contamination">AI contamination</h1>

<p>AI-generated text is already ubiquitous on-line, and it becomes more
and more difficult to identify AI-generated text. How long until
AI-generated (meaningless) text (including as answers in Q&amp;A sites),
will be (or are) re-used for training.</p>

<p>Outlets are terminating journalist contract to replace them by AI, and
independent writers are ‘competing’ against AI.</p>

<p>We have all faced AI chat-bots in so-called help-desks. But <a href="https://theconversation.com/ai-chatbots-are-intruding-into-online-communities-where-people-are-trying-to-connect-with-other-humans-229473">AI
chatbots are intruding into online communities where people are trying
to connect with other humans</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both of these responses were lies. That child does not exist and
neither do the camera or air conditioner. The answers came from an
artificial intelligence chatbot.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to a Meta help page, Meta AI will respond to a post in a
group if someone explicitly tags it or if someone “asks a question
in a post and no one responds within an hour.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are prime examples of <strong>enshittification</strong> (from
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">Wikipedia</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Enshittification is the pattern of decreasing quality observed in
online services and products such as Amazon, Facebook, Google
Search, Twitter, Bandcamp, Reddit, Uber, and Unity. The term was
used by writer Cory Doctorow in November 2022, and the American
Dialect Society selected it as its 2023 Word of the Year. Doctorow
has also used the term platform decay to describe the same concept.</p>

<h1 id="what-about-regulations">What about regulations?</h1>

<p>In the light of what has been said so far, I think it is reasonable to
wonder whether regulations shouldn’t be put in place, to address
current and future impact and scope of the technologies put in place,
their concrete risks and harms, and their implications in terms of
systematic (private) data collection and use. Every major big tech
company is investing vast amounts of money in AI technologies, data
centres, and data collection. And they are demanding returns on these
investments.</p>

<p>These same companies are actively lobbying to assure support in their
vested interested. This becomes clear when reviewing their
implications in various working groups and how AI is framed and
communicated to the public and various stakeholders.</p>

<p>Here are two examples, one very recent from the Guardian, and one that
directly relates to the influence of Silicon Valley on academia:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/article/2024/may/28/openai-safety-council-chatgpt">OpenAI forms safety council as it trains latest artificial
intelligence
model</a>:
The safety committee is filled with company insiders, including Sam
Altman, the OpenAI CEO, and its chairman, Bret Taylor, and four
OpenAI technical and policy experts. It also includes the board
members Adam D’Angelo, who is the CEO of Quora, and Nicole Seligman,
a former Sony general counsel.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/12/20/mit-ethical-ai-artificial-intelligence/">How Big Tech Manipulates Academia to Avoid
Regulation</a>:
The discourse of “ethical AI” was aligned strategically with a
Silicon Valley effort seeking to avoid legally enforceable
restrictions of controversial technologies.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>

<p>Despite some notable failures with ‘AI for public consumption’ , one
can’t ignore that there there are also success stories, and possibly
still untapped opportunities. But …</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AI can be kind of useful, but I’m not sure that a “kind of useful”
tool justifies the harm.</p>

<h1 id="update-2024-10-10">Update (2024-10-10)</h1>

<p>There are many more relevant articles that could be added and
referenced here, too many for me to keep up with. But the following
<a href="https://aus.social/@crumbleneedy/113280973349444816">Mastodon post</a>
by <em>sneedy maccreedy</em> and article it links to seem particularly
relevant:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>hinton getting the nobel is a good time to re-read @emilymbender ‘s
excellent piece on so-called ‘AI safety’ and different take on
hinton than you’re likely to see in the next few days</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The article is <a href="https://medium.com/@emilymenonbender/talking-about-a-schism-is-ahistorical-3c454a77220f">Talking about a ‘schism’ is
ahistorical</a>
by Emily M. Bender (also cited above), documenting the phony shism
rhetoric of AI safety fantasy on one hand and very real AI ethics on
the other.</p>
