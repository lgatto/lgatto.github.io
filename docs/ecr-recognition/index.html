        <p>The HUPO Early Career Researcher (ECR) committee has organised a
discussion panel on <em>Getting recognised for your work</em> and have asked
me to participate - thank you! I am always keen on such events,
organised by and for ECRs.</p>

<h2 id="introductions">Introductions</h2>

<p>The first part of the panel is a short 5-minute introduction of the
panellists, including <a href="https://www.malakerlab.com/">Prof Stacy
Malaker</a> from Yale University and <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/people/person/juan-vizcaino/">Dr
Juan Antonio
Vizcaino</a> from the
EMBL-EBI and myself.</p>

<p>I prepared this career flow chart as a visual aid:</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-ecr-recognition-careerpath.png" alt="Career path" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>I earned my PhD in 2006, from the <a href="https://www.ulb.be/">Free University of
Brussels</a> (ULB). My PhD work focused on the
evaluation of different types of evolutionary genetic markers to
study cetaceans phylogeny.</li>
  <li>During my PhD (probably around 2004 or so), when my work and
interests shifted toward bioinformatics, I started a part-time
degree in computer science at the <a href="https://unamur.be/">University of
Namur</a>. That lasted until I left Belgium for the
UK in 2010, after completing all my exams, but before finishing my
masters project - I never graduated.</li>
  <li>After my PhD, I worked for 3 years in industry, in a small company
(we probably were about 15 employees). I didn’t see much point in
continuing in academia at that point, considering my experience so
far and my personal situation. The environment and general
atmosphere was very much like an academic lab, with many more
collaborations within the team, and clear and common
objectives. This goal-oriented work environment was a very
refreshing experience that has been influential for the next steps
of my career. At some point, I felt I was starting to run in circles
and got a chance to move back to academia, at the <a href="https://www.cam.ac.uk/">University of
Cambridge</a> nonetheless.</li>
  <li>In 2010, I started a post-doctoral research associate (PDRA)
position in the <a href="https://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/">Cambridge Centre for
Proteomics</a>, working on mass
spectrometry-based proteomics.</li>
  <li>In 2013, I got promoted to senior research associate (SRA), which
allowed me to earn some grants as main PI and develop a small
research team.</li>
  <li>In 2018, I joined the
<a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/index.html">UCLouvain</a> as a professor of
bioinformatics. I teach in the <a href="https://uclouvain.be/fr/facultes/fasb">faculty of pharmacy and biomedical
sciences</a> (FASB) and run the
CBIO <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/">computational research
group</a> in the <a href="https://www.deduveinstitute.be/">de Duve
Institute</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>An interesting fact is that I started working on DNA during my PhD,
moved on with RNA in the private company, and since moving back to
academia, I have been focusing on proteins: my career followed the
main path of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology">central dogma of molecular
biology</a>.</p>

<p>To give more context to my career path, I also highlight some other
activities and interests, that have guided and supported my academic
activities.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I started to realise the importance of open and reproducible
research around 2010, both with respect to the rigour of doing
research, but also in the light of the (at times) <a href="http://bulliedintobadscience.org/">oppressive and
restrictive global research
environment</a> ECR have to
endure. The desire for others to benefit from my research by making
it as open, collaborative and reproducible as possible, and being
<a href="https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-rr-2/">vocal about it</a>, has
followed me since then.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="https://bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor project</a> has been
instrumental for me. It has allowed me over the years to meet and be
influenced by outstanding scientists, and has offered an
international environment in which I was able to grow and
flourish. I published my first (now retired) <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/3.12/bioc/html/yaqcaffy.html">Bioconductor
package</a>
around 2007 (Bioconductor 2.2 and R 2.7), and many more followed. I
am a Bioconductor package reviewer, a member of the European
Bioconductor (EuroBioc) conference organisation committee (I was a
local organiser for a handful EuroBioc conferences in Cambridge, in
2019 in Brussels, and in <a href="https://eurobioc2023.bioconductor.org/">2023 in
Ghent</a>), have been part
until recently of the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/code-of-conduct/">Code of
Conduct</a> committee,
am part of the social media working group, I co-lead the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/help/education-training/">Teaching
committee</a>, am
since 2018 member of the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/technical-advisory-board/">Technical Advisory
Board</a>,
and co-created, in 2021, the <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/european-bioconductor-society/">European Bioconductor
Society</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>

<p>The panellists were also asked to comment on how they have been
recognised for their work, with a particular emphasis their time as
ECRs. This is of course very subjective, and I’m not sure if my answer
will reflect how I have been recognised (assuming I have), or how I
hope I have been. I will also try to look beyond papers, the obvious
academic outputs - without those, there is little chance to get
academic recognition. This is of course a major problem, as there’s
much more to research than papers:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An article about computational science in a scientific publication
is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the
scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software
development environment and that complete set of instructions that
generated the figures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>[Buckheit and Donoho 1995, after Claerbout]</p>

<p>I think I’m known for the computational development and applications
in spatial (2010…) and single-cell proteomics (2018…), my efforts
to produce open and reproducible research, open and collaborative
software development, my R/Bioconductor contributions (some packages
have been around for since 2010) as well as my involvement in
teaching, such as international workshops (for example the mythical -
for me at least - Bioconductor <a href="https://csama2024.bioconductor.eu/">CSAMA
course</a> workshop).</p>

<p>One noteworthy aspect of my publication strategy, that highlights my
efforts for openness and reproducibility, is the workflow that
typically starts with the release of the software (more often than not
after review, on Bioconductor), then the publication of a pre-print
with code to reproduce the analyses and, eventually, a peer-reviewed
paper.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2024-ecr-recognition-pubworkflow.png" alt="open software, pre-print and paper publication workflow" /></p>

<p>I think I have gained some reputation as someome having expertise in
computational quantitative proteomics, including demonstrable
<em>technical skills</em>, in addition to more standard <em>scientific/academic
output</em>.</p>

<p>In terms of recognition, I suppose that invitations to give talks (for
scientific outputs), teach at workshops (pedagogical and technical
skills) and to submit papers are obvious goals. Being recognised for
my open and collaborative contributions with a <a href="https://bioconductor.org/about/awards/">Bioconductor community
award</a> is one of my proudest
moments. High on the list are also the
<a href="https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/">many</a>
<a href="https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs-2/">contributions</a> that the
<a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MSnbase.html">MSnbase</a>
package benefited from - some of these indirectly initiated the
collaborations that lead to the creation of the <a href="https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/">R for Mass
Spectrometry</a> initiative.</p>

<p>But what matters the most, in my eyes, and what in the end is the most
meaningul recognition, are the (shared) <strong>values</strong> that we promote
with the research we do, and the <strong>intrinsic motivation</strong> that drive
us.</p>

<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>

<p>We were also asked to prepare answers to three short questions. These
have been pre-determined by the HUPO ECR to get things going and give
us, the panellists, a chance to think about the comments we would like
to make.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When hiring a new postdoctoral researcher for your group, what are
the most important attributes for them to have on their CV? What do
you look for other than publication history?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are a couple of things I look for, and that I consider absolutely
essential, much more important than papers. Papers are only one of the
attributes that will help me assess the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Does the candidate’s skills match the project’s needs?</li>
  <li>What are <strong>concrete signs of mastery</strong>? I perform regular (and
constructive) appraisals with the researchers in my group, and one
question in that appraisal is “What do you want to become an expert
in?”. In a CV, I want to find what the candidate is an expert in,
whey they can teach me/bring to the lab.</li>
  <li>I also need to see public/open <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code>, such as for example
<strong>active</strong> Github/Gitlab profiles and repositories and
<strong>contributions</strong> (to their or other’s code base).</li>
</ul>

<p>And of course, last but not least, will the person be a good lab/team
member? It is of course very difficult (and arguably subjective) to
assess, but we (the lab) will be attentive to red flags pointing to
the contrary. In case of doubt, I will invite the candidate on site if
the interview (always with the whole group) was remote. I wouldn’t
want to take any risks that could harm the cohesion and well-being of
the group.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How would you recommend that ECRs promote their work other than
research e.g., teaching, outreach, committee work? Is there anything
they can do other than add a line on their CV?</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Yes, ‘add lines’ to your CV, but not at all costs. Be pragmatic! Not
need to run or teach workshops several time a year to demonstrate
that you have done some teaching. Don’t forget that your post-doc
years should be the most productive research-wise of your career!</li>
  <li>Promote <strong>your research</strong>, don’t be a vehicle for some else’s
research (typically your advisor), don’t limit yourself to merely
doing it. Show how you go the extra mile - for example by delivering
reproducible research.</li>
  <li><strong>Do things you like!</strong> Nothing beats motivation when it comes to
convincing others that you are good at what you do.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>How much does networking (either via social media or in-person
meetings) play a role in promoting your work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is <strong>very important!</strong> Networking are opportunities to learn,
share, discuss, and make yourself known, … Networking can be hard
though, so don’t be too hard on yourselves. It takes time.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple example illustrating the importance of building a
network: I happily spare myself organising and running interviews when
I can find a candidate in my direct or indirect network.</p>

<p>To build that network, there’s of course the in-person or remote
conferences and workshops, there may be social media (might not be for
everybody), but also Github issues and code and documentation
contributions and typo fixes. The large and small contributions are
very concrete examples that address the first question above.</p>
