<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Mass spectrometry-based single cell proteomics is a young and exciting
field that comes with many challenges. Great progress has been made in
recent years, and this conference is a hallmark of its success and
promises. In this presentation, we, that is Christophe Vanderaa and
myself, would like to share our efforts in proposing an infrastructure
for standardised and reproducible analysis of such data. We will
illustrate this infrastructure by presenting a replication of the
recent SCoPE2 data by Harrison Specht et al.</p>

<h3 id="the-value-of-replication">The value of replication</h3>

<p>We will focus here on computational replication, starting from the
low-level (PSM) quantitation data. We will posit that results that can
be reproduced are more trustable.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Expectation</strong>: the processing and analysis of data leads to
results and discoveries</li>
  <li><strong>Reality</strong>: many steps of the analysis pipeline can go wrong
leading to inaccurate, misleading, wrong results.</li>
</ul>

<p>A pipeline that can’t be reproduced is a pipeline that is ill defined,
that leads, mostly, to false discoveries. Of course, replication isn’t
a guarantee for accuracy, but an analysis that can’t be replicated is
one that can’t be trusted.</p>

<p>Replication is a first step towards a trustworthy and shareable
process. The development of non-trivial software tools isn’t done out 
of the blue, in isolation. Ideally, it is a collaboration between the 
developer, the data producer and the user. In other words Replication- 
or Reproduction-based development is an efficient approach to tool 
development.</p>

<p>Replication is of course only the first step to define sound data
infrastructure and principled analysis.</p>

<h3 id="why-scope2">Why SCoPE2</h3>

<p>The goal is not to focus on one type of single cell data
exclusively. Indeed, many of the processing steps that will be
mentioned are ubiquitous in quantitative data processing.</p>

<p>SCoPE2 offered an ideal reproduction-based development use case: full
protocol, data and analysis scripts are available, plus support from
the authors.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide5.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>Our objectives</p>

<ol>
  <li>Contribute a standardised and principled data and analysis that is
broadly applicable, i.e. to any MS-based single cell proteomics
data.</li>
  <li>Open, transparent and reproducible computational infrastructure
that can be leveraged to further improve data analysis and
interpretation.</li>
  <li>R and Bioconductor offer an ideal environment for this.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide6.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h2 id="scp-package"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> package</h2>

<h3 id="data-infrastructure">Data infrastructure</h3>

<h4 id="qfeatures"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code></h4>

<p><a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/QFeatures.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code></a>
(also recently accepted in Bioconductor) is a general infrastructure
(i.e. not specifically for MS-based single cell data) to manipulate
quantitative data from MS experiments. Proteomics data is multi-level:
data is acquired at the (low) spectrum level and protein-level data is
progressively built up through multiple processing steps. The goal of
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code> is to explicitly record the successive steps so as to
allow users to navigate up and down these different levels.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide8.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>The following example illustrates
what this means using a real data example. At the end of an analysis
pipeline, it is easy to check any proteins, here STAT1 and STAT3, and
verify the summarised expression profiles at the protein level, the
expression profiles and the peptides level or at the spectrum level
for labelled MS2 methods. Here, we can immediately visualise that the
former is composed of a single PSM/peptide, while the other displays a
more coherent profile for 10 PSMs/9 peptides.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide8b.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h4 id="singlecellexperiment"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code></h4>

<p>The scp package also relies on the work of colleagues working on 
single cell RNA sequencing, in particular on the 
<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code></a>
package. The figure here represents how the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code> data 
class captures single cell RNASeq data, which of course also fit single 
cell proteomics data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide9.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>Such an experiment is composed of primary and transformed
quantitative data, with genes/peptides/proteins along the rows and
cells along the columns.</p>
<ul>
  <li>A table that captures metadata along the rows.</li>
  <li>A table that captures metadata along the columns.</li>
</ul>

<p>An additional slot to store data from various dimensionality reduction
techniques, an important and widely used tool in single cell data
analysis.</p>

<h4 id="scp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/scp"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code></a> 
package relies on these two pieces of software,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code> to individually handle PSM, peptide and protein
level data, that are all, collectively linked and managed by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code>.  In addition, and most importantly, scp offers the function
to process and analyse the single cell proteomics data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide10.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h3 id="load-data">Load data</h3>

<p>To start the replication, we have formatted the supplementary data
from the SCoPE2 preprint using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> infrastructure that was
just introduced. The dataset is stored in a data package called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scpdata</code>. So, we load <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scpdata</code> and fetch the dataset that we called
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">specht2019v2</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide11.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">show</code> method gives a compact overview of the data object. The
header indicates the dataset is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code> object and it contains
179 assays. Remember, each assay within the dataset is stored
as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code> object. Assays 1 to 177 contain the
quantitative PSM data and metadata for the different SCoPE2 sets. They
contain either 11 or 16 columns, depending on whether the TMT-11 or 16
protocol was used. The before last assay contains the peptide data for
all sets. The last assay is the protein data assay.</p>

<p>The tabular data generated by MaxQuant or Proteome Discoverer can
easily be converted to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code> object using our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readSCP</code> 
function.</p>

<h3 id="metadata">Metadata</h3>

<p>The sample metadata that is common to all assays are stored in a
single table called the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colData</code> where each row represents a sample
in one of the assays and the columns are the metadata fields. In this
example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set</code> field gives the name of the SCoPE2 set, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Channel</code>
in which channel the sample was acquired, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SampleType</code> the type of
sample, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lcbatch</code> the chromatographic batch, etc.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide12.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>So, all useful information is contained in a single object, ready for 
processing.</p>

<h3 id="analysis-workflow">Analysis workflow</h3>

<p>The SCoPE2 analysis is composed of a series of data processing steps
and I just mentioned loading the data. We start the workflow with PSM
level data acquired over 177 different sets.</p>

<p>These data will go through feature filtering, division of expression
channel by the reference channel, aggregating the data to peptides,
combine the different sets in one, single-cell filtering,
normalization, removal of highly missing peptides, and
log-transformation. After these steps, we get the peptide data that is
provided in the preprint.</p>

<p>The peptides are then aggregated to proteins, normalized, imputed and
batch corrected to get the processed protein data from the article.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide13.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>We will not cover all steps but focus on a few representative ones.</p>

<h2 id="scp-showcase">scp showcase</h2>

<p>Let’s see how it works</p>

<h3 id="psm-filtering">PSM filtering</h3>

<p>One common functionality is to remove low-confidence features based on
the metadata stored along with the dataset.</p>

<p>For example, we want to remove PSMs that are matched to the reversed
database that serves as a decoy database. This information was already
generated by MaxQuant and is stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reverse</code> field of the
metadata. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filterFeatures</code> function takes our dataset and a
filtering condition. In this case, the features for which <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Reverse</code> is
not positive. The function then returns the dataset containing only
PSM that passed the condition. This is done automatically for all 177
PSM-level assays.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide15.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h3 id="data-filtering-compute-qc-metrics">Data filtering: compute QC metrics</h3>

<p>Of course, some QC metrics might be specific to single-cell proteomics
and are not computed by MaxQuant. For instance, SCoPE2 computes a
sample to carrier ratio to discard samples with intensities higher
than it would be expected. It also computes peptide FDR, the expected
proportion of features that are wrongly assigned to a given
peptide. Another example is to filter single-cells based on the median
coefficient of variation that indicates the reliability of the protein
quantification.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide16.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>We provide the functionality to compute those three metrics. See here,
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">computeMedianCV</code> takes the dataset, the name of the assay from which
the median CVs should be computed, here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peptides</code>, and the names of
the metadata fields that hold the required information for computing
the CV.</p>

<h3 id="data-filtering-plot-qc-metrics">Data filtering: plot QC metrics</h3>

<p>The computed CVs are stored in a new metadata field called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medianCV</code>
and allows for easy plotting and subsetting of the data. Let’s plot
the CVs. First, we retrieve the assay <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peptides</code> in which the CVs were
stored. Then we get the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">colData</code> where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">medianCV</code> is stored and
format it to a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data.frame</code> for plotting. The remainder of the code is
creating the histogram using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ggplot2</code>. We can see here that blank
samples exhibit much higher CVs than the single-cells and the black
line shows the cutoff used in SCoPE2 for filtering cells.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide17.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h3 id="feature-aggregation">Feature aggregation</h3>

<p>Next, feature aggregation allows combining features into a
higher-level structure. For example, multiple peptides can be
aggregated to a single protein. This functionality includes 2
steps. First, we combine the quantitative data from multiple peptides
to a single protein. Second, we store the relationship from the
aggregated peptides to the protein.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide18.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>We use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aggregateFeatures</code> for this. It takes the dataset, the
assay to aggregate, here the assay called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">peptides</code>, the name of the
newly aggregated assay, here <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proteins</code>, the metadata field name that
contains the protein to which the peptide belongs to, and a function
to combine the data with possible associated arguments.</p>

<h3 id="managing-missingness">Managing missingness</h3>

<p>Single-cell technologies do contain many zeros, and so does
single-cell proteomics. Zeros can either be biological zeros or
technical zeros. They are better replaced by the missing value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NA</code> to
avoid confusion in downstream analyses. This is done by
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zeroIsNA</code>. Again, we supply the dataset and the name of the assay for
which the zeros should be replaced.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide19.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>SCoPE2 and other single-cell pipelines remove highly-missing features,
for instance removing peptides that have over 99% missingness. This is
performed using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filterNA</code> function. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pNA</code> argument will
control the tolerated proportion of missingness.</p>

<p>Finally, missing data can be imputed using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">impute</code> function. This
code chunk imputes the assay called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proteins</code> using the KNN method
with k equals 3. Other methods are also available what facilitates
benchmarking of imputation methods.</p>

<h3 id="data-transformation">Data transformation</h3>

<p>Another processing step is data transformation. We provide common data
transformation function, such as normalization and
log-transformation. For instance, we apply a base-2 log-transformation
using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">logTransform</code> function. Beside the dataset, we need to
supply the name of the assay to transform, the log base, and the name
of the new assay that will contain the transformed data.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide20.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h3 id="custom-function">Custom function</h3>

<p>Finally, our framework can easily adapt to any custom function, for
example, batch correction using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComBat</code>. It requires a three-step
procedure.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide21.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>First, we extract the assay to process, here it is the
protein data. Then, we apply the custom function, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComBat</code> in this
case.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ComBat</code> requires a data matrix that we can access with the
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assay</code> function. The dots represent the required arguments that we
omit here for clarity. Once, the assay data is overwritten, we can add
the transformed assay back in the dataset using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addAssay</code>. Remember
that the added assay should be a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code>.</p>

<h4 id="replication-results">Replication results</h4>

<p>We replicated the SCoPE2 analysis using our standardized
framework. The results that are shown in the next slides compare the
expected SCoPE2 supplementary data with the output of our <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code>
framework.</p>

<h4 id="selected-features">Selected Features</h4>

<p>We first compared the selected features present in the two
datasets. The overlap between the selected features is very high, for
both the peptide and the protein data. Around 9000 peptides are common
to both workflows, with over 99% agreement. Similarly, for proteins,
around 2700 proteins are common to both workflows with over 97%
agreement.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide23.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<h4 id="numerical-comparison">Numerical comparison</h4>

<p>Next, we looked at the numerical differences. The graphs show the
distribution of the difference between the two datasets. In order to
do this, we had to subset the data matrices to common features and
samples. The distribution sharply peaks around 0 for both protein and
peptide data. The protein data is a bit more spread out because the
differences seen for the peptide data accumulate during the
processing.</p>

<h4 id="replicate-weighted-pca">Replicate weighted PCA</h4>

<p>Although small differences are seen, the datasets are highly
similar. This can be seen from the weighted PCA plots on the protein
data. The left figure can be found in the SCoPE2 preprint and the
right figure is our attempt to reproduce it. The two PCA plots exhibit
the exact same trend, indicating the underlying main patterns are well
replicated.</p>

<h3 id="note-about-replication">Note about replication</h3>

<p>Let’s finish the result part with a small note about reproducing data
analyses. Identifying key processing steps is essential for
reproducible work.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2020-09-10-scp-1-slide26.png" alt="SCP2020-presentation" /></p>

<p>Good software development includes continuous maintenance and
improvement. Changes in the implementation of algorithms can impact
the reproducibility of an analysis. For example, we noticed, with the
help of Harrison Specht, that the batch correction results using 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CombBat</code> depended on the software versions. These differences are due 
to a new invariant feature filter that was added recently to the batch
correction algorithm. This filtering step in turn highlighted
technical artefacts of the data.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<h3 id="take-home-messages">Take home messages</h3>

<p>Here are our main take home messages with regard to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> package.
We are all excited by MS-based single cell proteomics and are well
aware of the many challenges ahead. With <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code>, we offer a principled
and reproducible way to manage, process and analyse such data.  While
we have used SCoPE2 data as an illustration, the package isn’t limited
to MS2 labelled data. The processing functions in scp are perfectly
applicable to label free data which are generated using the nanoPOTS
method, which we also will highlight in future work.  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> uses the
same data structure as scRNAseq data, which facilitates, when
relevant, consistent data processing and integration of various single
cell assay modalities. Most importantly, perhaps, this is only the
beginning, and we are already using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> for the next generation of
single cell proteomics data modelling.</p>

<h3 id="resources-and-acknowledgements">Resources and acknowledgements:</h3>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">scp</code> package is publicly available at <a href="https://github.com/UCLouvain-CBIO/scp">this
URL</a> and has been submitted to
Bioconductor. We will also release the pre-formatted SCoPE2 data as
well as other single cell proteomics datasets that we use for our
method development. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QFeatures</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SingleCellExperiment</code>
packages have been available for quite some time now. Our slides are
also available at <a href="http://bit.ly/2020SCP">http://bit.ly/2020SCP</a>.</p>

<p>We would like to thank Harrison, Ed and Nikolai for their keenness to
share their data and experience with their data, the FNRS for funding
this work and you for your attention.</p>
