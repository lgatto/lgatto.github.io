<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>So I’ll start with a apology</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’m sorry for being a bad data champion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why I am a bad data champion?</p>

<p>My personal and limited experience indicates that my department isn’t
a place worth spending my time and energy in terms of good (and open)
data management. Why? Because I don’t see it as a place that values
that kind of skill set, open data, data management, reproducible
science… Time and effort invested in my department will mostly
remain unnoticed, and won’t benefit me.</p>

<p>Now that I have that out of the way, I can however share other efforts
I’m involved in, that are related to the data champions effort and
ethos. Here are some projects that I have been asked to share with
you. They might not necessarily strike as being in line with the data
champions efforts as outlined at the beginning of the initiative. But
there is a lot of work to be done in terms of good data management in
the light of more open, transparent and trustworthy science. I have
spend a lot of time and efforts over the last years thinking about
open research. I don’t have perfect solutions, only opinions (that I
think would make, IMHO, a positive change). And I have settled to
argue about issues and venues that I see as the most appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="the-open-research-pilot-project-orpp">The Open Research Pilot Project (ORPP)</h2>

<p>The ORPP is a joint project by
the <a href="http://osc.cam.ac.uk/">Office of Scholarly Communication</a> at the
University of Cambridge and the
<a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/what-we-do/our-work/open-research">Wellcome Trust Open research team</a>. From
<a href="http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-research/open-research-pilot-project">the official page</a>,
the pilot project looks at:</p>

<ul>
  <li>the support research groups need in order to make all aspects of
their research open,</li>
  <li>why they want to do this,</li>
  <li>how it benefits them,</li>
  <li>how it improves the research process</li>
  <li>what barriers there might be that prevent the sharing of their
research.</li>
</ul>

<p>Four research groups have been selected to participate. So far, the
project proceeds through meetings with all participants (every 6
months), discussions between the research groups and their recognised
OSC collaborator, blog posts and occasional emails on a dedicate
(private) mailing list.</p>

<p>I have written more about the
ORPP <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/open-research-project/">here</a>, where I
share my first post-kick off meeting thoughts about the project,
and <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/spatialmap-proposal/">here</a>, where I
wrote an public grant application describing the <em>SpatialMap</em> project.</p>

<p>My opinion at the moment is that, ironically, the project itself isn’t
open enough to really bring anything new to the debate (but maybe,
that is by design?). So far, all problems and needs that have been
highlighted (bad incentives, lack of rewards for being an open
researcher, need for better funding for open science, funding for
maintenance, sustainability, …) have been known and discussed online
extensively; the project would possibly benefit from the communities
wisdom and input. Also, so far, the project replicates the main issue
that we have with involving time to promote open research: it is an
activity that is mainly driven by individual researchers’ desire to
improve a research environment that doesn’t promote the best possible
research, without clear benefits for the researchers themselves.</p>

<p>My hope is that the participants will be in a position to provide
direct input to the Wellcome Trust and positively influence their
impact on the promotion of <em>open science</em> and <em>open scientists</em>.</p>

<h2 id="the-role-of-peer-review-in-promoting-open-science">The role of peer review in promoting open science</h2>

<p>This is based on a talk I gave at
a <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/osc-peer-review/">peer review meeting</a>
organised by the OSC in March 2017. The slides
are
<a href="https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html">available here</a>. There
is more
about
<a href="https://lgatto.github.io/peer-review-cup-discussion-panel/">peer review here</a>,
featuring a round discussion at Cambridge University Press as part of
<a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&amp;vertical=default&amp;q=%23PeerRevWk17">#PeerRevWk17</a>.</p>

<p>Main main argument, that is most relevant to the data champions
initiative is encapsulated in this question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reviewing data/software/methods: is this asking too much from reviewers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The above implies that the review can be very quick</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no data/software are available, there can’t be any review.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>

<p>(See <a href="https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html">slides</a> for
details)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>availability</strong>: data/software availability and a <em>reasonable</em>
description thereof</li>
  <li><strong>meta-data</strong></li>
  <li><strong>do numbers match?</strong>: Experimental design: 2 groups, 3 replicates,
but data files or columns: not a multiple of 6! Also look at the file
names; is there are consistent naming convention?</li>
  <li><strong>what data, what format</strong>: Is it readable with standard and
open/free software? Raw, processed, how to get from one to the
other? Summary table?</li>
  <li><strong>license</strong>: If you share anything, make sure users are allowed to
re-use it, and are aware of the terms under which they can re-use
it. Examples: CC-BY, CC0, GPL, BSD, …</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="quick-survey">Quick survey</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Is this asking too much?</li>
  <li>Who would like to see this done systematically?</li>
  <li>Who does this in their peer review activities?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The real question</strong> however is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>who applies these principles when they prepare data?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="my-ideal-review-system">My <em>“ideal”</em> review system</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Submit your data to a repository, where it get’s checked (by
specialists, data scientists, data curators) for quality,
annotation, meta-data.</li>
  <li>Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data. First
review the intro and methods, then only the results (to avoid
positive results bibs).</li>
</ol>

<p>As data champions, I think it is important to promote the importance
of data and data management on a day-to-day basis, but also to express
this ethic in our academic capacity, such as peer review.</p>

<h2 id="an-early-careers-view-on-modern-and-open-scholarship">An early careers view on modern and open scholarship</h2>

<p>This is a slide from a
<a href="https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/lgatto/2017_06_09_RDMF_London/blob/master/slides.html#section">talk I gave at the Research Data Management forum</a> (RDMF)
in July 2017, revering to the ORPP above.</p>

<p>In my opinion, barriers to Open Research (and the issues Data
Champions are addressing) are not technological, but rather at
political, institutional, community level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A critical point that is missing is the academic promotion of open
research and open researcher (*), as a way to promote a more
rigorous and sound research process and tackle the reproducibility
crisis. What should the incentives be? How to make sure that the
next generation of academics genuinely value openness and
transparency as a foundation of rigorous research?
(<a href="https://lgatto.github.io/open-research-project/">link</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(*) and here, I extend this to roles such as data champions, data
maintainers/curators, research software engineers.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>As data champions, our duty is to promote good data, good data
management and good data analysis, and, directly or indirectly, more
open and trustworthy research. ‘Open’ here refers to open to your
future self, open the your group/institute, or open to the research
community and to the public.</p>

<p>But I think we also need to reflect on the incentives in place to do
what we do, and the costs that these efforts have. Not because I
believe we shouldn’t make these efforts, but because we deserve to be
recognised and valued for our efforts.</p>
