      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        <p>The publish or perish crisis has led to a situation where, quite
understandably, being named on a paper is more important than the
actual contribution. As a result, authorship on scientific papers is
arguably one of the most pathetic lows in academia, from squabbles to
open conflict, pressure, politics and nepotism. But what does
authorship represent; who deserves to be an author?</p>

<h2 id="authorship">Authorship</h2>

<p>From
<a href="http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">Defining the Role of Authors and Contributors, International Committee of Medical Journal Editors</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The ICMJE recommends that authorship be based on the following 4 criteria:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the work;
or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the
work; <strong>AND</strong></li>
    <li>Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
intellectual content; <strong>AND</strong></li>
    <li>Final approval of the version to be published; <strong>AND</strong></li>
    <li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in ensuring
that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part of
the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And those who meet fewer than all 4 of the above criteria for
authorship should <strong>not</strong> be listed as authors, but they should be
acknowledged.</p>

<p>Well, that’s a rather strict definition of authorship. Whether one
agrees with it or one has another set of rules to grant authorship, I
think that every project should clearly state contribution
requirements in advance.</p>

<h2 id="position-in-the-author-list">Position in the author list</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>We are all equal, but some are more equal than others.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last/corresponding/senior author is supposedly the person that has
had the initial intellectual input, and initiated and supervised the
project; in practice, it’s often the person who acquired funding
(interestingly, the ICMJE specifically notes that <em>examples of
activities that alone (without other contributions) do not qualify a
contributor for authorship are acquisition of funding</em>).</p>

<p>The first author is the researcher who supposedly did most of the work
and wrote most of the manuscript. When research becomes more and more
multidisciplinary, it becomes less clear and more subjective what most
of the work really means. How do we quantify work and input, anyway?</p>

<p>All the other ones are <em>middle authors</em>, except possibly for the
second author, who is the one who has done second most of the work and
the penultimate author, who is the second most senior author. The rest
are <em>middle middle authors</em>.  I have not heard of anyone further
salami-slicing the author position/importance, but I wouldn’t be
surprised to hear so.</p>

<h2 id="author-contributions">Author contributions</h2>

<p>If author contributions, as required by some journals, are to be
recorded at the time of submission, using limited and restrictive
descriptions, I am afraid that they will hardly reflect real
contributions and will only serve a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>

<p>From
<a href="http://f1000research.com/articles/4-900/v1#referee-response-10508">this open review</a>
by Rob Patro, regarding an interesting experiment by Titus Brown,
<a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2015-authorship-on-software-papers.html">granting every committer on github authorship</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If we are interested in the long-term viability and quality of such
software, we must adopt a system of credit that values and
recognizes a variety of different types of contribution.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, I think a better, fairer and open credit system is welcome
beyond contributions to software. Shouldn’t we have github-like
repositories for all our scientific projects, carefully recording
ideas, data, analyses, outcomes, code, interpretation, manuscripts,
… that we could then make use of the report and demonstrate
effective contributions?</p>

<p>To be honest, while I use github private and public repositories
(<a href="https://github.com/lgatto/">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit">2</a>) extensively (for
grant writing, for specific analyses in the frame of collaborations,
for software and teaching, for manuscripts), I hardly have a
single repository for the whole scientific process (that’s not how
things work, in practice). In the future, I will, for the sake of
transparency, more systematically and explicitly define rules for
contributions as part of the repository, and ask contributors to
assess and document their respective contributions.</p>

<h2 id="trust-and-open-science">Trust and Open Science</h2>

<p>Last week, I attended a seminar about
<a href="http://osc.cam.ac.uk/open-scholarship-and-links-academic-integrity-reward-recognition">Open scholarship and links to academic integrity, reward &amp; recognition</a>
by Professor Tom Cochrane. The presentation and questions thereafter
touched upon a wide range of topics related to Open Science at
large. One comment that struck a chord was the importance of trust at
every level in Science. Often, at higher managerial levels, major
directions might (or might not) be followed if trust and confidence
exists between two partners, even if their exchange is very brief and
not necessarily backed-up by hard facts. These senior academics have
evolved in an environment where they have learned to trust (or
distrust) their peers through reading scientific literature, meeting
and listening to their peers, collaborating with each other, etc.</p>

<p>Today, we have a wonderful mechanism in place to build this network of
trusted peers: it’s called Open Science. What better reason to trust a
scientist who openly sharing ideas, data, software, code, reviews,
papers etc.</p>

<p>I have realised that a fundamental reason that I value Open Science so
much is that it is, in my eyes, a more objective way to identify
trustworthy individuals in this scientific and academic
eco-system. And conversely, my desire to be as open as possible in my
research and promote Open Science through my research outputs is a
manifestation of this desire to expose my work and myself as a
trustworthy and honest scientist.</p>
