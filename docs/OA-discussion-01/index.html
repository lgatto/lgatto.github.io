      <section class="page__content" itemprop="text">
        <p>Last week, <a href="http://richardpoynder.co.uk/">Richard Poynder</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/RickyPo">@RickyPo</a> on Twitter) organised an
informal get together around open access (OA), that was attended by
researchers, publishers and librarians. A broad range of points were
discussed, but one aspect caught my attention in particular, which I
wanted to write down.</p>

<p>I will start with a comment
by <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/is/staff/pinfield">Stephen Pinfield</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/StephenPinfield">@StephenPinfield</a> on Twitter),
who mentioned that many proponents of the green OA route (which I
consider myself one of) see it as a way to disseminate research and
not as a business model (which the golden OA route, the dominant model
in the UK, certainly has become<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>). The views of these green OA
proponents are often based, rarely explicitly though, on author
processing charge (APC), albeit very low ones.</p>

<p>Later, we had a quick survey where all participants shared what they
thought a fair APC should cost - this wasn’t meant to be an objective
assessment (because a lot of what is said and felt related to OA is
very subjective). The range of suggestions ranged from $5 (based on
the arXiv model) to $3500. The reason for such a huge variance, and
some (arguable very) high APCs comes from cost unrelated to
publication. <a href="https://www.gen.cam.ac.uk/directory/sudhakaran-prabakaran">Sudhakaran Prabakaran</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/wk181">@wk181</a> on
Twitter), who has first hand experience with AAAS, explained that
these costs include, for example, the news that are published in the
journal Science; for eLife, represented by Emily Packer
(<a href="https://twitter.com/PackerLEmily">@PackerLEmily</a> on Twitter), APCs
of £2500 (based
on
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/b6365b76/setting-a-fee-for-publication">this post</a>,
down from
£3147
<a href="https://elifesciences.org/inside-elife/a058ec77/what-it-costs-to-publish">projected cost for 2016</a>),
include the development of new publishing platforms (that are released
as open source software, by the way).</p>

<p>I found it quite revealing; personally, I don’t want to pay for news
and views as part of my APCs, but I might consider paying for them
independently. Similarly, while I do believe that there is a need to a
modern publishing platform, I am not convinced that my APCs should
necessarily include such costs; or at least researchers should be able
to decide how much they want to contribute to this. And let’s not
forget that the money that pays for APCs comes from the funders (my
previous sentence is misleading, as researchers don’t pay for APCs
themselves).</p>

<p>One comment and suggestion that I found particularly noteworthy was
from <a href="http://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/people/cto/jrjg1">Rupert Gatti</a>
(<a href="https://twitter.com/rupertgatti">@rupertgatti</a> on Twitter),
co-founder
<a href="https://www.openbookpublishers.com/">Open Book Publishers</a>. The
publication of a hard-copy book at Open Book Publishers ranges between
£3500 and $4500 (which is very low compared to the average costs of
other mainstream publishers, peaking around 30K for small publisher
and increasing for major players). Rupert made an important point in
denouncing APCs, in that they explicitly separate research and its
publication. This is certainly a major issue in the current climate:
researchers <em>don’t pay</em> for APCs; the money comes straight from
funders via their university library), and assume everything works
behind the scenes, including licensing (and loosing the rights to
their outputs). He suggested that if we embedded publishing into
research, the cost would become essentially zero (in line with costs
of pre-prints). While one could argue that publishing by third-party
professionals has some benefits, if we consider that researchers do
most of the fundamental work (from doing the research, writing and
reviewing the research papers), one wonders if separating research and
its dissemination at such a high cost is a reasonable solution.</p>

<p>Finally, we also briefly discussed different publishing models, beyond
the green and golden OA models that are currently mainstream.</p>

<p><strong>Flipping</strong>, where publishers would flip to a fully OA model and
would be paid by bulk deals. This is what I believe the current
dominant golden OA model in the UK was meant to lead to.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional publishing</strong>, which exists, but is rarely used as a means
to comply to the OA mandate.</p>

<p><strong>Funder-based publishing</strong>, such as what the <a href="https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/">Wellcome
Trust</a>, the <a href="https://gatesopenresearch.org/">Gates
Foundation</a>, … do through the <a href="https://f1000research.com/">F1000
publishing platform</a>. <a href="https://www.ubiquitypress.com/">Ubiquity
Press</a> has a similar model, I believe.</p>

<p>And there are probably more that I’m missing… (feel free to comment
to expand the list).</p>
<div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
  <ol>
    <li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
      <p>This is the model that was favoured in the UK. The Finch report envisioned that it would lead to a change in academic publishing (more on that later), which has arguably failed. OA has been hijacked by commercial publishers and there is currently little hope for a more fundamental revision of the publishing landscape. <a href="#fnref:1" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
