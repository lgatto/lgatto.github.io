<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I am always particularly keen to discuss open and reproducible
research, which is a topic that is very close to my heart. Interacting
with early career researchers makes it even more thrilling because
those are the ones that will (hopefully) make a bigger change for the
best. Believe it or not, ERCs are unlikely to be able to rely on their
senior peers to drive that change.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I wanted to my personal experiences and opinions. I am
not speaking from authority here. Authority generally comes from
seniority, and in most cases senior academics aren’t those that have
much experience in open and reproducible research.</p>

<p>Another thing I don’t plan doing here is listing technical solutions
on how to implement open and reproducible research. I would be very
happy to answer your technical questions if you have any, or follow up
by email or twitter. You’ll also have the oportunity to discuss with
your peers during the social gathering, many of which will be able to
help very efficiently. The main reason I won’t focus on technical
aspects of open and reproducible research is that I very much doubt
that technical aspects are the real barrier. We have many solutions at
hand. The real challenges are the (academic) environment we are in,
the inertia of academia and the vested interests of many senior
actors.</p>

<p>For a start, here are three quick remarks about open and reproducible
research in relation with the title of the talk/post, and I will of
course define/discuss these terms in more details later - I will just
assume for now that you know, at least vaguely, what I am referring
to.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open != good (by default)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A piece of open research doesn’t automatically make it good, where
good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of closed
research doesn’t make it bad, where bad here is defined of low
academic quality. So openness doesn’t equate to academic
quality. But openness provides some desired quality (i.e. desirable
property) independent from academic excellent. Openness leads to
trust (more details later).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Reproducible != good (by default)</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>A piece of reproducible research doesn’t automatically make it good,
where good is defined as of high academic quality. A piece of non
reproducible research doesn’t make it bad, where bad here is defined
of low academic quality. So reproducible doesn’t equate to academic
quality. But reproducibility provides some desired quality
(i.e. desirable property) independent from academic
excellent. Reproducibility leads (among other things) to trust (see
details below).</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Open research and reproducible research aren’t the same thing, and
one doesn’t imply the other. Even though in our modern understanding
of these terms and concepts, they are intimately linked,
historically, they are very different.</li>
</ul>

<p>While a lot of the things I will talk about are relatively recent (I
consider myself a <em>modern</em> open researcher), note that the principles,
implicit or explicity of open research/science aren’t new. I was
pleasantly surprised when learning about the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mertonian_norms">Mertonian
norms</a></strong> (Robert
Merton, 1942).</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Communism</strong>: all scientists should have common ownership of scientific
goods (intellectual property), to promote collective collaboration;
secrecy is the opposite of this norm.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Universalism</strong>: scientific validity is independent of the
socio-political status/personal attributes of its participants.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Disinterestedness</strong>: scientific institutions act for the benefit of a
common scientific enterprise, rather than for the personal gain of
individuals within them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Organised scepticism</strong>: scientific claims should be exposed to
critical scrutiny before being accepted: both in methodology and
institutional codes of conduct.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Inverse problems</strong> are hard!</p>

<p>Where is the scholarship?</p>

  <p>An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and that complete set of instructions that generated the figures.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-is-open-research">So what is open research?</h2>

<p>Open science has seen a continuous evolution since the 17th century,
with the advent of dissemination of research in scientific journals
and the societal demand to access scientific knowledge at
large. Technology and communication has further accelerated this
evolution, and put it in the spot light among researchers and
academics (for examples funder mandates) and more widely in the press
with the cost of publications (see for example this Guardian <em>long
read</em> article <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science">Is the staggeringly profitable business of scientific
publishing bad for
science?</a>
or the <a href="https://paywallthemovie.com/">Paywall</a> movie).</p>

<p>So what is open research? What characterises a modern open researcher?</p>

<p>Let’s start with a definition</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open science/research is the process of transparent dissemination
and access to knowledge, that can be applied to various scientific
practices (image below from Wikipedia):</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and a figure</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Open_Science_-_Prinzipien.png" alt="The six principles of open science" /></p>

<p>What I dislike about the previous figure is that it can give the
misleading impression that open research is about collecting badges,
and that the more badges you possess, the better an open researcher
you are. And reciprocally, not having any badge to display
<strong>excludes</strong> one from being an open researcher. And as soon as people
start to believe this, we will stop practicing open research and will
start doing stamp collection.</p>

<p>Incidently, here’s an ironic tweet that offers tips to do exactly that:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">21 Tips on
how to sound <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openscience?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#openscience</a>:
in the last three weeks before x-mas, I will tweet on tip each day on
how to sound like an open scientist, without actually doing open
science. Enjoy! <a href="https://t.co/K7TXb9UmHM">pic.twitter.com/K7TXb9UmHM</a></p>&mdash;
Egon Willighⓐgen (@egonwillighagen) <a href="https://twitter.com/egonwillighagen/status/1334411812973015040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December
3, 2020</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>On a side note, I very much prefer the Mertonian norms shown above
that address more fundamental principles intimately related to the
principles of open research.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open science/research can mean different things to different people,
in particular when declined along its many <strong>technical</strong>,
<strong>administrative</strong>, <strong>legal</strong> and <strong>philosophical</strong> attributes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An important word above is <strong>excludes</strong>: as thriving open researchers,
we need to understand that it isn’t only the distance towards
better/open research that we have travelled that is relevant, but that
the starting point matters a lot. The way somebody practices open
research, whether that person has the possibility to implement this or
that open (and reproducible) research practice, or whether they can be
vocal about it mostly depends on their environment and the support or
push back they get.</p>

<p>Embrace open and reproducible research to the extend you want and you
can. Seek allies and support around you, but do not feel pressured. It
isn’t open or close. It is certainly not the same open or close for
everybody.</p>

<p>So my very first take-home messages are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open isn’t binary, it’s a gradient, it’s multidisciplinary, it’s
multidimensional.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>How to be an open scientist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s be open and understanding of different situations and
constraints, including our own.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="perverse-side-effect-open-research-as-a-business">Perverse side-effect: open research as a business</h2>

<p>Everything that is labelled as open research isn’t open of good. An
easy example is <del>Open Access</del> <strong>Open Acce$$</strong>, a very lucrative
business model set up by commerical publishers… and supported,
directly or indirectly by most researchers.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Green open access</strong>: post your <strong>pre-print</strong> (on
<a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">bioRXiv</a>,
…), get a DOI and credit. :-)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Gold open access</strong>: pay a lot of money (APC article processing
charge), typically 3000 -
<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-03324-y">9500</a> Euros
(which many will be <a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/natures-oa-fee-seems-outrageously-high-many-will-pay-it">ready to
pay!</a>)
to publish your article in a journal under an open access
licence. <strong>For-profit</strong> publishing (typically <strong>huge profits</strong>). :-(</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Platinum (diamond) open access</strong>: 100% free to pubish and free to
read, usually financed by university, funders, research
organisations centrally. <strong>Non-profit publishing</strong>. :-)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Read and publish ‘transformative’ agreements</strong>: combining
subscriptions (to read) and APCs into big deals, this (1)
obfuscating real costs, (2) lock-in into a contract with specific
publishers, and (3) discriminate against institutions/countries that
can’t afford them (see this

<p>As far as I was concerned for a long time (until June 2017 to be
accurate - this section is based this <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/open-and-open/">Open science and open
science</a> post), the former
more technical definition was always what I was focusing on, and the
second community-level aspect of openness was, somehow, implicit from
the former, but that’s clearly not the case.</p>

<p>Even if there are efforts to promote diversity, under-represented
minorities (URM) don’t necessarily feel
<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/357/6356/1101.full">included</a>.
When it comes to open science/research URMs can be further
discriminated against by greater exposure or, can’t always afford to
be vocal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not everybody has the privilege to be open.</li>
  <li>There are different levels in how open one wants, or how open one
could afford to be.</li>
  <li>Every voice and support is welcome.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given the very broad views and opinions about what open research is,
or is supposed to be, I think we can agree with <a href="https://twitter.com/CameronNeylon/status/895546085468495873">Cameron

  <p>Does it take more time to work openly?</p>

<p>Isn’t it worth investing time is managing data in a way that others
(including future self) can find and understand it? That’s, IMHO,
particularly important from a group leader’s perspective, where I
want to build a corpus of data/software/research that other lab
members can find, mine and re-use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No. (not necessarily)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Is there a risk of being scooped?</p>

<p>There certainly is a benefit if releasing one’s research early!</p>

<p>But, importantly, working with open and reproducible research in mind
<strong>doesn’t mean releasing everything prematurely</strong>, it means</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>managing research in a way one can find data and results at every

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>one can <strong>reproduce/repeat</strong> results, re-run/compare them with new

<p><img src="/images/doi-10.1098-rsos.160384.png" alt="The natural selection of bad science" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Abstract</strong> Poor research design and data analysis encourage
false-positive findings. Such poor methods persist despite perennial
calls for improvement, suggesting that they result from something
more than just misunderstanding. <strong>The persistence of poor methods
results partly from incentives that favour them, leading to the
natural selection of bad science.</strong> This dynamic requires no
conscious strategizing—no deliberate cheating nor loafing—by
scientists, only that publication is a principal factor for career
advancement. Some normative methods of analysis have almost
certainly been selected to further publication instead of
discovery. In order to improve the culture of science, a shift must
be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding
understanding. We support this argument with empirical evidence and
computational modelling. We first present a 60-year meta-analysis of
statistical power in the behavioural sciences and show that power
has not improved despite repeated demonstrations of the necessity of
increasing power. To demonstrate the logical consequences of
structural incentives, we then present a dynamic model of scientific
communities in which competing laboratories investigate novel or
previously published hypotheses using culturally transmitted
research methods. As in the real world, successful labs produce more
‘progeny,’ such that their methods are more often copied and their
students are more likely to start labs of their own. Selection for
high output leads to poorer methods and increasingly high false
discovery rates. We additionally show that replication slows but
does not stop the process of methodological deterioration. Improving
the quality of research requires change at the institutional level.</p>

<p>Incentives for open career progression aren’t there (yet?), or not
fully implemented. On the contrary…</p>

  <p>If <em>research is the by-product of researchers getting promoted</em> (a
quote by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_W._Barron">David Barron, Professor of Computer Science</a>,

career researchers (ECRs), focus on promotion and being docile
academic citizens rather than aiming for the more noble cause of
pursuing research to understand the world that surrounds us, and
disseminate our findings using modern channels?</p>

<p>In my opinion, barriers are not technological, but rather

  <li>Abuse of power dynamics</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Repeat</strong> my experiment, i.e. obtain the same tables/graphs/results

same computer. That’s basically re-running one of my analysis some
time after I original developed it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reproduce</strong> an experiment (not mine), i.e. obtain the same
tables/graphs/results in a different lab or on a different computer,
using the same setup (the data would be downloaded from a public
repository and the same software, but possibly different version,
different OS, is used). I suppose, we should differentiate
replication using a fresh install and a virtual machine or docker
image that replicates the original setup.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Replicate</strong> an experiment, i.e. obtain the same (similar enough)
tables/graphs/results in a different set up. The data could still be
downloaded from the public repository, or possibly
re-generate/re-simulate it, and the analysis would be re-implemented
based on the original description. This requires openness, and one
would clearly not be allowed the use a black box approach (VM,
docker image) or just re-running a script.</p>

present five reasons why working reproducibly pays off in the long
run and is in the self-interest of every ambitious, career-oriented
scientist.</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility helps to avoid disaster</strong>: a project is more than
a beautiful result. You need to record in detail how you got
there. Starting to work reproducibly early on will save you time
later. I had cases where a collaborator told me they preferred the
results on the very first plots they received, that I couldn’t
recover a couple of month later. But because my work was
reproducible and I had tracked it over time (using git and GitHub),
I was able, after a little bit of data analysis forensics, to
identify why these first, preliminary plots weren’t consistent with
later results (and it as a simple, but very relevant bug in the
code). Imagine if my collaborators had just used these first plots
for publication, or to decide to perform further experiments.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility makes it easier to write papers</strong>: Transparency
in your analysis makes writing papers much easier. In dynamic
documents (using
<a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">rmarkdown</a>,
<a href="https://jupyter.org/">juypter notebook</a> and other similar tools),
all results are automatically update when the data are changed. You
can be confident your numbers, figures and tables are up-to-date.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility helps reviewers see it your way</strong>: a reproducible
document will tick many of the boxes enumerated above. You will
make me very happy reviewer if I can review a paper that is
reproducible.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility enables continuity of your work:</strong> quoting
Florian, “In my own group, I don’t even discuss results with
students if they are not documented well. No proof of
reproducibility, no result!”.</li>
  <li><strong>Reproducibility helps to build your reputation:</strong> publishing
reproducible research will build you the reputation of being an
honest and careful researcher. In addition, should there ever be a
problem with a paper, a reproducible analysis will allow to track
the error and show that you reported everything in good faith.</li>

<p>This section is based on my <a href="https://rawgit.com/lgatto/2017-03-30-OSC-peerreview/master/slides.html">The role of peer-reviewers in <del>checking
supporting information</del> promoting open
science</a>
talk.</p>

<p>As an open researcher, I think it is important to apply and promote
the importance of data and good data management on a day-to-day basis
(see for example Marta Teperek’s 2017 <a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.897785">Data Management: Why would I
bother?</a> slides), but also to
express this ethic in our academic capacity, such as peer review. My
responsibility as a reviewer is to</p>

<ul>
  <li>Accept sound/valid research and provide constructive comments</li>
</ul>

<p>and hence</p>

<ul>
  <li>Focus on the validity of the research by inspecting the data,
software and method. If the methods and/or data fail, the rest is
meaningless.</li>
</ul>

<p>I don’t see novelty, relevance, news-worthiness as my business as a
reviewer. These factors are not the prime qualities of thorough
research, but rather characteristics of flashy news.</p>

<p>Here are some aspects that are easy enough to check, and go a long way
to verify the availability and validity and of the data</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Availability</strong>: Are the data/software/methods accessible and
understandable in a way that would allow an informed researcher in
the same or close field to reproduce and/or verify the results
underlying the claims? Note that this doesn’t mean that as a
reviewer, I will necessarily try to repeat the whole analysis (that
would be too time consuming indeed). But, conversely, a submission
without data/software will be reviewed (and rejected, or more
appropriately send back for completion) in matters of minutes. Are
the data available in a public repository that guarantees that it
will remain accessible, such as a subject-specific or, if none is
available, a generic repository (such as
<a href="https://zenodo.org/">zenodo</a> or <a href="https://figshare.com/">figshare</a>,
…), an institutional repository, or, but less desirable,
supplementary information or a personal webpage<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Meta-data</strong>: It’s of course not enough to provide a wild dump of
the data/software/…, but these need to be appropriately
documented. Personally, I recommend an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README</code> file in every top
project directory to summarise the project, the data, …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Do numbers match?</strong>: The first thing when reproducing someone’s
analysis is to match the data files to the experimental
design. That is one of the first things I check when reviewing a
paper. For example if the experimental design says there are 2
groups, each with 3 replicates, I expect to find 6 (or a multiple
thereof) data files or data columns in the data matrix. Along these
lines, I also look at the file names (of column names in the data
matrix) for a consistent naming convention, that allows to match
the files (columns) to the experimental groups and replicates.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What data, what format</strong>: Is the data readable with standard and
open/free software? Are the raw and processed available, and have
the authors described how to get from one to the other?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>License</strong>: Is the data shared in a way that allows users to
re-use it. Under what conditions? Is the research output shared
under a valid license?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Make sure that the data adhere to the
<strong><a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618">FAIR</a> principles</strong>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Findable and Accessible and Interoperable and Reusable</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note that SI are not FAIR, not discoverable, not structured,
voluntary, used to bury stuff. A personal web page is likely to
disappear in the near future.</p>

<p>As a quick note, my <em>ideal</em> review system would be one where</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your data to a repository, where it gets checked (by
specialists, data scientists, data curators) for quality,
annotation, meta-data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Submit your research with a link to the peer reviewed data. First
review the intro and methods, then only the results (to avoid
positive results bias).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When talking about open research and peer review, one logical
extension is <strong>open peer review</strong>.</p>

<p>While I personally value open peer review and practice it when
possible, it can be a difficult issue for ECRs, exposing them
unnecessarily when reviewing work from prominent peers. It also can
reinforce an already unwelcoming environment for underrepresented
minorities. See more about this in the <em>Inclusivity: open science and
open science</em> section below.</p>

<p>Open research <strong>can</strong> lead to <strong>collaborative research</strong>. The
development of the <a href="https://www.rformassspectrometry.org/">R for Mass
Spectrometry</a> initiative and
<a href="https://github.com/lgatto/MSnbase/"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MSnbase</code></a> is <a href="https://lgatto.github.io/msnbase-contribs/">an
example</a> I am very proud
of.</p>

<p>Collaborative work and cooperation is certainly one important concept
that gravitates around open science/research (see the Mertonian norm
of <em>communism</em>), but that isn’t necessary nor sufficient for open
science.</p>

<h2 id="final-food-for-thought">Final food for thought</h2>

<p>Science as <a href="https://youtu.be/zwRdO9_GGhY">Amateur Software
Development</a>, by Richard McElreath.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Science is one of humanity’s greatest inventions. Academia, on the
other hand, is not. It is remarkable how successful science has
been, given the often chaotic habits of scientists. In contrast to
other fields, like say landscaping or software engineering, science
as a profession is largely <em>unprofessional</em>—apprentice scientists
are taught less about how to work responsibly than about how to earn
promotions. This results in ubiquitous and costly errors. Software
development has become indispensable to scientific work. I want to
playfully ask how it can become even more useful by transferring
some aspects of its professionalism, the day-to-day tracking and
back-tracking and testing that is especially part of distributed,
open-source software development. Science, after all, aspires to be
distributed, open-source knowledge development.</p>

<p>Building a brand as an <strong>open</strong> early career researcher – see
<a href="https://www.stephaniehicks.com/blog/building-a-brand-as-a-scientist/">Building a brand as a
scientist</a>
by Stephanie Hicks.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Making discoveries and contributing your ideas and/or work are
fundamental components of being a scientist (I am treating of the
word “scientist” very broadly here). However, another important
component of being a scientist is learning how to build your “brand”
as a scientist.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>Just do it! (if you are in a position to)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Build openness and reproducibility at the core your research</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(according to you possibilities)</p>

<p>Don’t wait</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open and reproducible research doesn’t work if it’s an afterthought.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Standing on the shoulders of giants</strong> only really makes sense in
the context of open and reproducible research.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you are here (or have read this), chances are you are on the path
towards open and reproducible research.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You are the architect of the kind of research and researcher you
want to become. I hope these include openness and reproducibility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a long path, that constantly evolves, depending on constraints,
aspirations, environment, …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The sky is the limit, be creative: work out the (open and
reproducible) research that works for you now …</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>… and that you want to work (for you and others) in the future.</p>
