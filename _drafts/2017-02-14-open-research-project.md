I am proud to be one of the participants in the
[Wellcome Trust Open Research Project](https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=1286)
(and
[here](https://blog.wellcomeopenresearch.org/2017/02/10/piloting-more-openness-at-the-university-of-cambridge/)). The
call was initially opened in December 2016 and was pitched like this

> Are you in favour of more transparency in research? Are you
> concerned about research reproducibility? Would you like to get
> better recognition and credit for all outputs of your research
> process? Would you like to open up your research and make it more
> available to others?
>
> If you responded 'yes' to any of these questions, we would like to
> invite you to participate in the Open Research Pilot Project,
> organised jointly by the Open Research team at the
> [Wellcome Trust](http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/) and the
> [Office of Scholarly Communication](http://osc.cam.ac.uk/) at the
> University of Cambridge.

This of course sounded like a great initiative for me and I promptly
filed an application. 

We had our kick-off meeting on the 27th January, with the aim of
getting to know each other and somehow define/clarify some of the
objectives of the project. This post summarises my take on it.

Here's how I introduced myself.

#### Who are you?

[Laurent Gatto](https://lgatto.github.io/), Senior Research Associate
in the Department of Biochemistry, physically located in Systems
Biology and the Maths Department. [SSI](software.ac.uk/) fellow and
[Software](https://software-carpentry.org/)/[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/)
instructor and generally involved in the Open community in Cambridge,
such as [OpenConCam](http://openconcam.org/) and
[Data Champions](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/datachampions) initiative.

#### What is your research about and what kind of data does your research generate?
	
My area of research is computational ciology, with special focus on
high-throughput proteomics and integration of different data and
annotations. I use raw data produced by third parties, in particular
the
[Cambridge Centre for Proteomics](http://proteomics.bio.cam.ac.uk/)
(mass spectrometry data), and produce processed/annotated/interactive
data and a lot of [software](https://github.com/lgatto/) (and also
[here](https://github.com/ComputationalProteomicsUnit/)).

#### What motivated you to participate in the Pilot?

Improve openness/transparency (and hence reproducibility/rigour) in my
research and communication, and participate in improving openness (and
hence reproducibility/rigour) more widerly.

#### What kind of outputs are you planning to share? Do you foresee any difficulties in sharing?
	
My direct outputs are systematically shared openly early on: open
source software (before publication), pre-prints, improved data (as
data packages). Difficulties, if any, generally stem from
collaborators less willing to share early and openly.

### A personal take on the project

It is a long project, 2 years, and hence a rather ambitious one, of a
unique kind. Hence, we will have to define its overall goals as we
go. The continued involvement of the participants over time will play
a major role in the project's success.

What are attainable goals? 

It is important to note that there is no funding for the
participants. We are driven by a desire to be open, benefit from being
open and the visibility that we can gain through the project, and the
prospect that the Wellcome Trust will learn from our experience and,
implement any lessons learnt.

A lot of our initial discussions centred around rewards for open
research or, actually, lack thereof and percepted associated
risks. Indeed, the traditional academic rewarding system and the
competitiveness in research leaves little room for reproducibility and
openness. It is, I believe, all participants hope that this project
will benefit us, in some form or another.

A critical point that is missing is the *academic* promotion of open
research and open researcher, as a way to promote a more rigorous and
sound research process and tackle the *reproducibility crisis*. What
should the incentives be? How to make sure that the next generation of
academics genuinely value openness and transparency as a foundation of
rigorous research?

### Some desired outputs

Ideally, I would like that all *Research investigator awards* to be de
facto ***Open research** investigator awards*. There's currently a
split (opposition?) between *doing research* and *supporting open
science we doing research*. In every grant I have written, I had to
demonstrate that the team had a track record, or was in a good
position to successfully pursue to proposed project. Well, how about
demonstrating a track record in being good in opening and sharing
science outputs? Every researcher submitting a grant should
convincingly demonstrate that they are, have been and/or will be
proactive open researcher and openly disseminate all the outputs. By
leading by example in the frame of this Open Research Project, this is
something that the Wellcome Trust could take away from.

Unfortunately, it is a fact that open science is not on the agenda of
many (most?) more senior researchers and that they are neither in a
position to be open nor that open scienc is a priority at all. I find
it particularly disheartening that many senior academics (i.e. those
that will sit on the panel deciding if I'm worth my next job) consider
investing time in open science and the promotion of open science as
time wasted of actually doing research. A bit like time for outreach
and promotion of science to the wider public is sometimes looked down
at, as not being the real stuff.

Another desire is that this project will enable us to **influence
funders**, such as the Wellcome Trust, of course, but also more widely
the research councils. 

As a concrete example, I would like all grants that are accepted to be
openly published beyond the daft *layman summary*. Published grants
after acceptance should include data management plan, the pathway to
impact, possibly more, and these could then be used to assess to what
extend the project delivered as promised.

Another concrete output is the requirement for a dedicated *software
management plan* for each grant that involves any software
development. I certainly consider my software to be equivalent to data
and document it as such in
[my DMPs](http://riojournal.com/articles.php?id=11624), but there
seems to be a need for clarification.

I believe that I do a pretty decent job in conducting open science:
pre-prints, open access, release data, ... In the frame of this
project, I shall do a better job at promoting open science for its own
sake. 

I also hope that by bringing some of my projects under the umbrella of
the the *Open Research Project*, I will benefit from a broader
dissemination that will, directly or indirectly, be beneficial for my
career (see the importance of benefits and rewards above).

### Next steps

It is important to make the most out of this unique opportunity. We
need to create a momentum, define ambitious goals, and work hard to
reach them. But I also think that it is important to get as much input
as possible from the community. Nothing beats collective intelligence
for such open-ended projects, in particular for open projects.

So please, do not hesitate to comment, discuss on twitter or
elsewhere, or email me directly if you have ideas you would like to
promote and or discuss.
