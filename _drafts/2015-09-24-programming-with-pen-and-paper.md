## Introduction


The biggest hurdle in introducing programming to young children are
computers. Indeed, with all their bells and whistles, modern computers
are a constant distraction for young children, or more generally for
new users. Where to look, what to focus on? I think this is even more
acute since now every child is accustomed to using tablets, and their
experience of using 'computers' is very much driven by intuitive
interfaces and instant gratification. Typing abstract keywords on a
keyboard is certainly not an inviting experience.

## Scratch programming

[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a graphical programming
language, that provides visual abstractions to programming concepts
such as simple instructions, interaction, conditions,... Scratch
programs are created by drag and dropping these visual elements to
create programmes that control a cat on the screen.

> and animations - and share your creations with others in the online
> community.

> systematically, and work collaboratively - essential skills for life
> in the 21st century.

From my personal experience with my older son (now 9), even getting
him interested in Scratch is a bit challenging. While the why and how
of all these visual elements were clear to me because I could see a
wider context, I find it difficult to introduce them in an interesting
way. While the interface is without any doubt great and easy to
navigate for someone who gets the bigger picture, I think it is still
overwhelming for a newcomer. When trying to learn Scratch programming
using this [book](https://www.nostarch.com/scratch), my son was focusing
on the final product, a computer game he could play with (and
imagining one as sophisticated as the ones plays with on the DS of tablet),
rather than the process of creating it. In other words, the computer
was more of a distraction rather than a tool to create, or think about
how to create something.

## Pen and paper

This reminded me of the opening quote, and my own experience, where
algorithms or programmes I develop tend to be better when I first
think about them using pen and paper rather than frantically
assaulting the keyboard right away.

Using the great Scratch platform as a source of inspiration, I printed
and cut a set of simple instructions on little paper tags: `Move _
steps`, `Turn _ degrees`, ... where the young programmers had to fill
in the `_` parameters.

Before using the tags, we had a short discussion on what a programme
(or algorithm) was, i.e. a set of steps or instructions that they
would create, and that they (or somebody else, or a computer) would
then execute. Each young programmer then got a sheet with a simple
labyrinth on squared paper, a little character, and was asked to lay
out the instructions needed to lead their character through the maze.

The exercise went quite well. Our young programmers (aged 6 to 9) all
wrote their own algorithms (the most difficult part was actually
getting the angles and turning directions right - the programming
course was a good revision for angles and degrees) and executed each
others. We even discussed what kind of metrics we could infer from
these programmes; for example, would we calculate the length of the
programme in number of operations or in the total number of steps?

I also prepared other instructions, such as `Repeat _ times`, `Pen up`
and `Pen down`. For the latter, the other adult in the team created an
algorithm that wrote her name. We saw that, despite a relatively short
name, we ended up with a long set of instructions. This led then to a
short discussion on using mini programmes that could write single
letters inside other programmes, that would write names. I had never
planned to mention such elaborated, abstract concepts, but they came
up naturally when experimenting with programming without the technical
barrier of using, or learning to use, a tool.

I think the experiment went well. For the next session, I might give
them all the same slightly more challenging maze, and they would need
to design the shortest path to exit, or ask them to execute some
algorithms to uncover a secret word.
